Now occupied by Stool Pigeons, a sort of sports bar concept, there isn't really a lot to like.  What they do have is a nice patio area outside, and it is a good place to sit when the weather is good.\n\nThe downside to that is the servers don't do a good job of keeping things clean, and when you ask if they can clean it up, the first reaction is one where you are putting undue requests on them, the second reaction is one that you realize the grill-like tops of the tables don't clean well and the third reaction is that you get to see the other buildings of the area in their rundown state (they are in bad need of pressure washing).\n\nOther than being able to enjoy good weather, the only thing you get is not having to sit inside a rather smoky environment.  Even in the entry area it can get bad.  Beyond there it's even worse.\n\nBut let's move onto the food.  It sounds pretty decent.  It isn't.\n\nRather than try the somewhat overpriced food, we opted to go for several appetizers.  The chips and cheddar dip were horrid.  The chips were stale and the cheese congealed.  The onion strips were okay, but just a massive brick of them was just to much.  It could have done the same job with half - or even a quarter - as many on the plate.\n\nThe other choice was made was for the sliders (mini burgers), and they were decent, especially with some of the onion straws on them.  Combined with the rest, however, it was just not good.

Your donuts are fried right after you order them at Chez Boris, they are small, so you can order one or two or three depending on how much you want, and the crazy thing is that they are only 0.50 cents each. They come fresh out of the frier and get dusted in confectioner's sugar, so you get them just a tiny bit crispy, just the right amount of sweat, I didn't know what I was missing!!

Everything you think Montreal should be!\n\nKeep your eye out for all the Qu\u00e9bec celebrities hanging out in this joint!! Not that you will necessarily recognize them if you don't live here, but anyhow, they usually wear sunglasses at night.

In addition to the smoked brisket, Turkey, pork and chicken, they have excellent sandwiches, salads, and a pretty good Tortilla soup. A friend of mine swears they have the best tuna salad he's ever had, the Ancho BBQ Meat Loaf is awesome, and in addition to the regular menu, the specials are generally fantastic.

Drove to a place down the street from me -- figured it would be open, but wasn't.

Our order for 2 adults and 3 kids was:\n\n- BBQ Spare Ribs (app)\n- Crab Puffs (app)\n- House Special Fried Rice\n- Sweet & Sour Pork\n- Fuji Steak\n- Shrimp & Lobster Sauce\n\nThe food was absolutely delicious and there were plenty of left overs (which reheated amazingly well, some was even good cold).  The Spare Ribs and Fuji Steak stood out as especially good, while the sweet & sour was average.  But overall, it was excellent and we were all very happy with it.\n\nAs of this writing I've been back once with the family, and I intend to go back many more times.  On the second trip, we had sweet & sour chicken and I'd say it was just as average as the pork was.  Other new dishes were:\n\n- Seafood Fire Pot: this was quite good, but I doubt I'll order it again.  There was a generous portion of lobster, scallops, and shrimp (for $11, anyway), but it was a little too bland.\n\n- House Lo Mein: this dish pretty much rocked.  The noodles weren't soggy, and it wasn't too greasy either.\n\nThis place has a fairly extensive menu.  And, the lunch combo prices look unbeatable.

It was a strange \"sucking\" sound...really...You didn't hear it? Oh wait, I know what it was, it was Hyde Park sucking all the money out of my wallet. Silly me, how could I not have known that I entered the big leagues when I walked in this place? You're almost bound to see a few Steelers here, CEO's, and other assorted big wigs. So when you want to play in that arena, you better be prepared to pay for it. And at Hyde Park, you do. Really.\n\nBefore I comment about the food, I must make a disclaimer that I am not a huge steak fan. I suppose I enjoy a good hunk of bloody meat from time to time but all in all, I typically steer clear. Ha, ~steer~ clear, get it?!\n\nAs of winter time 2006-2007, there are really 3 steakhouses in Pittsburgh, Morton's, Ruth Chris, and Hyde Park with the latter being a newcomer only opening in October 2006. So balancing between them, I would have to say Morton's has them beat in terms of steak, but Hyde Park is a close second. Whereas Morton's concentrates on just throwing a prime piece of meat in front of you, Hyde Park likes to dress theirs up in various sauces (mostly butter-based) and give them clever names like the Lemieux, the Stargell, the Rooney, etc.\n\nWhere Hyde Park lasso's you in (trying to stick with the whole cattle theme), is on decor and service. This place looks awesome, straight up. Dark woods, big deep red drapes, white table cloths, a fireplace. nice. The place begs you to come in have some great drinks and get your chow on. But the temptation doesn't stop there. The service here is so impeccable that you feel bad not taking any of their suggestions on wine, entrees, desserts, or where the restroom is located.

I had tried Chang Jiang a couple years ago, and was not at all pleased. A couple weeks ago, my brother convinced me to order from CJ. I tried the sesame chicken, and it was delicious. The downside: it took almost two hours to arrive. They had forgotten our order, and only realized it after we called them back after 90 minutes. Apparently their other location was closed for the night, so they were handling all orders out of one restaurant. Unfortunate, but since it was so tasty and a weird circumstance, I overlooked it.\n\nTonight, Christmas Eve, I decided to give them another go. They have a $15 minimum delivery, so I ordered two entrees figuring it'd make me plenty of tasty meals over the holiday weekend when nothing else is open. I ordered the sesame chicken again, and an order of lemon chicken. The food arrived in 30 minutes, but unfortunately it was...\n\nBarf city. \n\nWhile the sesame chicken last time consisted of tasty chunks of white meat that kept their crispy coating despite soaking in sauce, this time it was especially fatty dark meat that was hard to cut and had a very displeasing mouth feel. I had expected the lemon chicken to be similar to the sesame chicken or sweet and sour chicken - battered chunks with a gooey sauce. Instead it was a chicken breast pounded flat and breaded with crumbs. The sauce was served on the side, and that's a good thing: it was so lemony and watery it seemed fake. It felt more like I was adding a dose of Lysol to my meal than a burst of citrus goodness. The chicken itself was okay, but really was no better than a cheap patty and not at all what I think of when considering Chinese takeout. \n\nIf I knew I'd be getting the same delicious batch of food I got a couple weeks ago, I'd go back to Chang Jiang for sure. However, tonight's failure ($22 with tax and tip down the drain - hopefully I can get someone to eat the leftovers so it's not a total waste) will probably prevent me from ordering there again.","delta.star":-0.5,"review.effect":"Negative","average.stars":"2.5","review.stars":"2","sentiment":-0.0787837582229736,"Topic 1":0.00518290470522852,"Topic 2":0.085026691757259,"Topic 3":0.00914321179286729,"Topic 4":0.00975102059659235,"Topic 5":0.011614755704141,"Topic 6":0.185742108333729,"Topic 7":0.0138064519200016,"Topic 8":0.0077507196296959,"Topic 9":0.252413871981213,"Topic 10":0.00493567362453358,"Topic 11":0.195919582874593,"Topic 12":0.150519577010684,"Topic 13":0.0222177545147578,"Topic 14":0.00704230067341293,"Topic 15":0.0389333748812905},{"id":133,"body":"This place was recommend by the hotel I was staying at.

G-Bot only had an hour for his lunch but we figured that Pizza Hut would probably be the quickest option due to it's convenient location. Oh boy, how wrong we were.\n\nAs soon as we walked in we realised it was choc-a-block but with such a short space of time we didn't really want to head anywhere else as at lunchtime, everywhere is busy in this area. We stood at the door in a short queue and waited to be finished. We waited to five minutes before anyone even acknowledged that we were standing there waiting. All of the staff seemed to be doing nothing in particular all just aimlessly walking around doing their own thing, making to contact with any customers or doing anything worthwhile. \n\nAfter around 15 minutes we were finally sat down and told to wait to get our order taken. We waited five minutes and nobody came so seeing as we just wanted to buffet we decided just to go up, we couldn't sit there forever and we were starving! I grabbed a plate and stuffed as much salad as I could on it and I got a few slices of pizza but there was hardly anything left and we were told to come back in a couple of minutes till they got a new batch out. \n\nWhile we were sitting eating the small couple of slices we'd managed to grab a waitress came up to us and asked us if we were ready to order. HELLO!? We are sitting eating here, are you blind? This is probably the most bizarre question I've ever been asked in a cafe/restaurant/diner/anywhere really.\n\nThe pizza was pretty tasteless to be honest and the potato salad that I got seemed to be garnished with a water dressing that tasted like absolutely nothing and the cucumbers were cut about 4 inches thick.\n\nOh another thing, for some reason the napkins were cellotaped around the cutlery so when you took the tape off it ripped the napkin. It appears that the idiots really are running the asylum at this branch of Pizza Hut. This was levels of incompetence I've never experienced, anywhere. I realised it was busy but seriously these were schoolboy errors. \n\nThis lunchtime experience was a disaster, I realise it's Pizza Hut buffet and it's cheap and it's simple food but the service and the food was appalling and I won't be hurrying back.","delta.star":-1.5,"review.effect":"Negative","average.stars":"2.5","review.stars":"1","sentiment":-0.0378629887905146,"Topic 1":0.0078409741838012,"Topic 2":0.160027286120348,"Topic 3":0.00887014988107617,"Topic 4":0.00282665370338323,"Topic 5":0.00377617342436784,"Topic 6":0.178057761814902,"Topic 7":0.0130177948986756,"Topic 8":0.110941648515147,"Topic 9":0.0233127398870044,"Topic 10":0.0020526368760445,"Topic 11":0.406511238499786,"Topic 12":0.0188163077187639,"Topic 13":0.00721113946940655,"Topic 14":0.0475209377692197,"Topic 15":0.00921655723807419},{"id":137,"body":"Trust-- this place has the best sushi rolls in Montreal.   \n\nThe \"decor\" is very unassuming, just a few simple tables and chairs with some dollar-store decorations, but don't let that discourage you! The real star of this place is the food. They've got a huge selection with lots of variety and everything we've tried was really fresh and well made. I hate it when you bite into a futomaki and, because the seaweed is going stale, all the goods come toppling out all over the place. That doesn't happen here. They're also really generous with the caviar and sesame seeds, as well as the pickled ginger garnish. The spider roll (softshell crab, caviar, crabstick, cucumber, lettuce) is to die for, so are the dragon eye (salmon, white tuna, shallot, carrot, all lightly deep-fried, caviar, lettuce, sesame-- and is also beautiful, by the way) and tentation (tuna, tempura, shallot, shrimp, and caviar wrapped in a paper-thin slice of avocado). We also really like the rolls wrapped in yellow soya paper for something different. But they've also got the standards: spicy tuna, spicy salmon, 911, philadelphia, rainbow, unagi, etc., etc. All the rolls run around $7. The only roll I've tried that I didn't like was the spicy crab. I also can't comment on the nigiri and sashimi as I've haven't tried any of either.   \n\nNever go to those horrible chains.

I work close, so it's kind of nice to go here as a change of pace, but not on any sort of regular basis or anything.\n\nJust a funny note: I did spellcheck here on yelp.com, and they suggested \"testis\" for \"tzatziki.\" ha!","delta.star":0,"review.effect":"Neutral","average.stars":"3","review.stars":"3","sentiment":0.25902441820908,"Topic 1":0.0450819003147402,"Topic 2":0.253708601681917,"Topic 3":0.161122760933843,"Topic 4":0.0082020581764698,"Topic 5":0.0422691997563443,"Topic 6":0.0582615030283027,"Topic 7":0.0731296758191999,"Topic 8":0.0108524351995692,"Topic 9":0.0135493394840308,"Topic 10":0.00897078960674099,"Topic 11":0.0846737479993811,"Topic 12":0.152246327346609,"Topic 13":0.0307818127792813,"Topic 14":0.039069703097286,"Topic 15":0.0180801447762847},{"id":151,"body":"Really huge menu...  breakfast, lunch and more.

Inside of a grocery store. Hey guys, don't worry  it'll work! Well, it does work. On many levels, this concept works. Lets pour another and discuss this new addition to the Biltmore bar scene (I know, I know. Just trust me, its an addition):\n\n~Fud/Drink~\nFirst off, before I go further, they have a huge selection of local beers. If you know me, you know I love local. Its a me thing. From Papago Brewery to Four Peaks, they have 26 local beers to choose from, as well as 10 other regular brands you are used to. The prices are higher however, so keep in mind you will be paying much more....unless you do Happy Hour (4pm-6pm) when its $2 off! Beers on tap run from $5-$9...come during HH. They also do have beer flights, which during non-HH hours is a good deal when looking to try new things.\n\n As for the food, wow, it really does taste great. I ordered the Kale Caesar Salad, which was refreshing and delightful. A citrusy Caesar dressing really tied this salad together, and after I ordered mine, I saw 5 other orders come out...its good, get it! My fiance got the Camelback Burger. It came pretty raw. Our waitress was made aware, took it straight to the kitchen, and ordered some cheesy tater tots for us (we didn't ask, she did it). After 10 minutes, her burger comes back, and the bite I had was amazing. Some type of southwestern aioli sauce added on, was outstanding. Food looks superb, everything from pizzas to even sushi, which also looked stellar. Next time, I will come in for sushi....and yes there will be a next time.\n\n~Atmosphere/Service~\nIt is a very random mix of two separate atmospheres. If you are sat inward, towards the main bar area with the taps, it feels very bar-like. You are more compact, its dimmer, it has a bar feel to it. The bar juts outward into the store, much like an airport bar. Depending on where you sit, you will get a different ambiance...It actually works well, believe it or not. Its definitely a good place to kick back with friends after work....Yep, a grocery store after work, superb place to go for a drink Jeff.\n\nAs for the waitress, she was outstanding. She comped our meal, despite us making a very small request for them to re-heat the burger. I felt uncomfortable having her comp it, it was a simple first day mistake, but I am sure they were being careful, being opening day and all...We didn't ask for the comping, but hey, she gave it to us. I ordered an extra beer and gave her a fine tip. She was very aware of the foods on the menu and also helped out a lot with beer selection. Good job on her end. The other wait staff were very attentive and quickly helped clean our plates off the table and asked if we needed anything else. Good service!\n\n~Extras/Rating~\nOverall, this is is about a 4 star spot. I however, had a 5 star experience, mainly because the service was outstanding. The food is impressive, and despite prices, I was very happy to pay what we were originally going to pay.....before it got comped. Selection is stellar, the sushi adds a different element, and it doesn't take away from the bar fare. Seriously, try the Kale Caesar...you'll agree with me later. I have nothing but good things to say about this place. But please, come during HH or to one of the daily specials I posted in the pictures...save your money!!

Though the Matthews location has been remodeled in the last few months.  But what it lacks in atmosphere it makes up for in value.  For just $3.99 (slightly more if you'd like something other than water to drink), you can get a full-blown pizza buffet.  That's right, unlimited trips to their buffet, featuring a number of pizzas, including bread sticks and dessert pizzas!\n\nMost CiCi's locations also feature pasta of some sort or another, and all that I've seen also have a nice salad bar.  The price for kids is usually a dollar or so less, but I have seen some staggered pricing - so kids of one age might be a dollar less, while kids of another age might be a dollar-and-a-half less.  Check your local locations for exact pricing.  But for less than $5 each, it's tough to find an all-you-can-eat anything, and the quality is actually quite good.\n\nIt's not New York style pizza or anything, but for family-style dining, it's nothing to be sneezed at, either.  When you can go to fast food and drop $20 on a family of four, or a CiCi's and get out for under $15, I'd pick CiCi's almost every time.  The environment is nicer, the food is better, the whole experience is just a nicer one.  And don't forget that you don't have to order off of the buffet.

As an example, the menu listed a line with a seafood item, then listed a beef item and then back to a seafood item.  There did not seem to be any rhyme or reason for it; at least one that I could decipher.  While deciding on what to eat, I went with a quick order of a beer.  The place is not a microbrewery, so based on a recommendation I went with the Dogfish Shelter Pale Ale from their tap selection.  It was served in an official Dogfish glass.  The beer had a nice strong flavor without being heavy.  After more struggling with the menu and the food descriptions (see photo), I ended up going with the safe route, a burger & fries.  With my order, I asked that they sans the cheese but did not think to inquire about the mayo situation.  The burger & fries arrived hot and nicely presented on a ceramic dish with the fries in a metal can/ sleeve.  With burgers, it has been my experience in a brew pub setting that normally the mayo is an item that is provided on the side.  Unfortunately for me this was not the case, as mayo was slathered on both sides of the bun.  So I ended up just eating the beef patty w/ a knife and fork.  I must say that the beef was good because it tasted like a cut of a steak which to me signaled it was of good quality.  The side of fries was crisp but had a green, and I assume, dill seasoning that I did not prefer.\n\nService - The service I had was okay...nothing above and beyond.  She did ask if everything was okay, but based on my obvious confusion with the menu it would have been nice if she had mention that the burger comes w/ mayo on it...oh well.\n\nPrice - The menu is pretty varied in price, from a $10 hamburger & fries to dishes costing around the $20 price point.  With my $5.50 draft, my meal came in just over $20 w/tip.\n\nOverall - It was a so-so experience.  Would I go again...probably not?  But the beer selection is worthy of a beer lover to at least check out.","delta.star":-1.5,"review.effect":"Negative","average.stars":"3.5","review.stars":"2","sentiment":0.19523151963198,"Topic 1":0.00818740060639976,"Topic 2":0.0526675036154035,"Topic 3":0.161204502674411,"Topic 4":0.00958642570419652,"Topic 5":0.182267694594951,"Topic 6":0.0713003108164511,"Topic 7":0.0790993924785608,"Topic 8":0.00495535118928044,"Topic 9":0.0105705176608432,"Topic 10":0.00505121207036848,"Topic 11":0.11464538856791,"Topic 12":0.101359039544655,"Topic 13":0.177637562177245,"Topic 14":0.00812669156659193,"Topic 15":0.0133410067327321},{"id":179,"body":"I was privileged to be the first ever customer at the Grand Opening of this beautiful new restaurant this morning!

The menu features featured salads with kitschy names like \"It's Chic to Be Greek\" and \"Chinese Chopstick\" or you can come up with your own \"unique\" salad by choosing from all the different lettuce mixes, vegetables, dressings, cheeses, and meats. All salads either come in \"Jr\" or \"Full\" sizes. They also offer a few types of wraps.\n\nIf I sound unenthusiastic, it's because I am! I have nothing against a good salad - in fact, the Stetson Chopped at Cowboy Ciao, the Grilled Vegetable at California Pizza Kitchen, and the Broadway Pea at Kincaid's are all noteworthy salads in my book and would make me remember and return to those restaurants in the future. However, that being said, I just don't think the majority of salads are all that special or satisfying, especially not for a main course. I need substance to my meals, and a salad usually just doesn't cut it. \n\nNow I don't want to unfairly bias people against this franchise concept  or this location - the salad I got (the Chopped Veggie) was chock-full of really fresh vegetables and the roasted garlic vinaigrette was really flavorful, and it was a lot of salad for $5. But it just didn't give me that satisfying feeling I get after having a meal with carbs or lots of protein. If you love salads and the concept of getting a salad specially made and tossed to your specifications (sort of like the \"sandwich artistry\" Subway has made famous but with salads), you will love this place.

Our server recommended the lobster corn dogs so we gave them a shot.  He also recommended the crab cakes and the tuna starter.  The tuna poke was great quality and well prepared but we were not crazy about the lobster dogs or the crab cake.  I asked the server what kind of crab it would be and he said lump crab meat.  I asked what kind of crab and he didn't seem to know.  He agreed when I suggested 'blue crab?' I'm not sure what it was but it it didn't seem like lump blue crab meat.  \nFor our sides we tried the mac and cheese, mushrooms, and corn on the cob.  The corn was the winner. \nEntrees: fish and chips- the fish looked great but it covered the fries completely in the basket and created a steaming effect that made the fries soggy.

I believe they brought in new management a few years ago and it's made a WORLD of difference in both service and quality of food.\n\nUnfortunately I'm a fan of fried (yah, I know) popcorn shrimp and Alaskan whitefish, and they prepare both beautifully here, in traditional \"fish camp\" style.  They really shine at lunch time, where daily specials are around FIVE BUCKS and you get dinner-size portions!  They do have broiled options, but those aren't available as lunch specials (however they're still priced reasonably).  One thing I like about them is that they're flexible.  This means that you don't HAVE to get fries with your meal; you can opt for a baked potato if you prefer and they don't say anything or get confused as some places do.  Or you can get double fries/no hush puppies...whatever works for YOU, not them.\n\nI think one of their star options is the \"family pack\" they offer.  This has got to be one of THE best deals in town, especially when trying to feed a family at dinner.  You get a TON of food for $27 & change (including tax!).   For under thirty dollars you get your choice of TWO seafood options (ie two lbs of baby shrimp and eight pieces of flounder), a very large box of hush puppies, and a very large box of fries or four baked potatoes.  You also get a TUB each of cocktail sauce, tarter sauce and cole slaw.  Plenty of food for a family of 2-4.  OH - you also get a half gallon of tea.\n\nService here is always speedy and friendly as well, and that has a lot to do w/the change in management I believe.  I worked in the neighboring office for many years & for a while a few years ago we actually boycotted them for quite some time BECAUSE of their service.  But now they're wonderful!  Orders are always correct and on time (especially important when time is of the essence), and the employees are always super friendly and accommodating, and seem genuinely interested in making sure your experience is the best it can be.\n\nHarbor Inn - a great option for traditional seafood in the University City area.","delta.star":0,"review.effect":"Neutral","average.stars":"4","review.stars":"4","sentiment":0.39808282645522,"Topic 1":0.0213859273014634,"Topic 2":0.225953599265055,"Topic 3":0.0177874596085435,"Topic 4":0.0207528039066412,"Topic 5":0.0674642433310126,"Topic 6":0.0263890221640318,"Topic 7":0.171970884437634,"Topic 8":0.0131738879587404,"Topic 9":0.0370120399485899,"Topic 10":0.00577980546744418,"Topic 11":0.0614109265863833,"Topic 12":0.0592534685217323,"Topic 13":0.116110999109477,"Topic 14":0.0713697489976389,"Topic 15":0.0841851833956121},{"id":213,"body":"Good pizza considering the price.

He would make the rolls and bring them out to the table and ask how the last roll was and what we liked or disliked. He was awesome and will make you any roll you can think of. The server was on top of the water and also asked for any feedback that we were willing to give. The food was way better then the other AYCE sushi places in town and I will be back...

They have a pretty big bar area with a good selection of brews & pretty good tv viewing. While the atmosphere inside invokes a large sports restaurant, the outdoor patio area is relatively small but you'll always be in the shade.\n\nThe wings aren't anything spectacular & I'm not sure how they won best wings in Charlotte by Creative Loafing. Nevertheless, they do have tons of sauce choices, but the prices are really unreasonable. If you aren't going there with a large group that all want wings, then expect to pay quite a bit per wing. For me, the wing quality just doesn't equal the price you pay. So the wings are better than average, but you can find plenty of places serving better ones for cheaper.\n\nOther than the wings, the other menu items are actually pretty good too. From slider burgers, to wraps, you can usually find something you're in the mood for, & I really haven't had anything I wasn't happy with. But once again, I just think the prices are a little steep for the quality of food you're getting. \n\nSo overall, I'd say Wild Wings is a nice retreat to watch a game or grab a brew, but make sure you go with a beefy group to order the wings in bulk, or else expect a pricey tab at the end of the night.","delta.star":0,"review.effect":"Neutral","average.stars":"3","review.stars":"3","sentiment":0.65783825482545,"Topic 1":0.00866091876578668,"Topic 2":0.305508336118635,"Topic 3":0.237577987122357,"Topic 4":0.0017955679794662,"Topic 5":0.0687973351744182,"Topic 6":0.0175358695640027,"Topic 7":0.121338247595373,"Topic 8":0.1344305804585,"Topic 9":0.00511482819567978,"Topic 10":0.00222341764138731,"Topic 11":0.0264000285457482,"Topic 12":0.012280770064848,"Topic 13":0.018942677291665,"Topic 14":0.0224362963842678,"Topic 15":0.0169571390978647},{"id":222,"body":"I order takeout from this particular China Joes on a regular basis.

The premises were previously occupied by Fleur's Deli. \nI'm quite happy about this change, as the place has been spruced up and it now looks modern and more 'alive'. \n\nI usually just have a soup for lunch, but sometimes a girl needs to treat herself.. Especially when they are offering wraps such as bbq pulled pork with homemade coleslaw. The wrap was toasted and filled with delicious, succulent pulled pork and slaw. I could not fault it it any way, it was just right. I paid \u00a33.30.\n\nThey were also offering 2 different kinds of soups, and you can request a small, medium or a large soup. The sandwiches on the counter looked absolutely amazing and would satisfy any appetite, I'm sure. \n\nShore Deli, being a deli, also sell fine food products such as Scottish Heather Tea and ...

When I checked the place out, there is a big sign right above the place that says \"Chuck Wagon\". So why no one has done a listing is beyond me. The casino itself is a separate entity but when you go over the reviews, about 80 percent of it pertains to the restaurant.\n\nSo here's the first offficial review for this listing.\n\nLike everybody else, I was drawn by the billboards off of Boulder Highway about their food specials. One example is the Barbeque Combo Plate for 9.99 which consists of 1/4 Babyback Ribs, Beef Brisket, and 1/4 rotisseried Chicken accompanied by Baked Beans and a mini Corn on the Cob. Another is Steak and Petite Lobster for 9.99 as well. They also have your basic steak and potatoes for 5.99 which is not a bad deal.\n\nI got the Barbeque Combo because the picture from the billboard looked rather enticing. The Babyback Ribs were surprisingly tender and flavorful. The Beef Brisket was ok and the Chicken was a bit dry. All items were topped off with a drizzle of tangy barbeque sauce which I thought was pretty tasty. The corn was your basic corn and the baked beans tasted like it was from a can.\n\nThe restaurant itself is a little bit cozy meaning they got a decent amount of tables and booths kind of crammed together. So dont be surprised if you have to wait a bit especially for dinner. I went on a monday at 11:45 am and only waited for about 2 minutes.\n\nAs for the service, nothin major to complain about or take my hats off to. You do get what you pay for in terms of service. I recommend you not be in any hurry if you plan on eating here. Overall, the staff is friendly from my first impression.\n\nSome random info: These guys are open 24 hours and you dont need a player card to get the food deals. The bathroom is in the casino to your right when you exit the restaurant. Occasionally you will get a whiff of the second hand smoke coming from the casino, especially if you have a bunch of smokers out there on the slots and tables.\n\nIn conclusion, I will definitely come back to try their other specials and most definitely will come here if I have friends or family that just want decent food at good prices.","delta.star":0,"review.effect":"Neutral","average.stars":"4","review.stars":"4","sentiment":0.265150104882228,"Topic 1":0.0130037619638889,"Topic 2":0.167796348991419,"Topic 3":0.0742693686124965,"Topic 4":0.0198453164824977,"Topic 5":0.0885547868118771,"Topic 6":0.0573906537142092,"Topic 7":0.100066055388373,"Topic 8":0.00806655565464773,"Topic 9":0.0359527555993248,"Topic 10":0.00848262356936202,"Topic 11":0.139327703075031,"Topic 12":0.247972550793727,"Topic 13":0.0131172846720726,"Topic 14":0.00818677369985044,"Topic 15":0.0179674609712227},{"id":238,"body":"CHIPS and SALSA (2 kinds) and BEAN DIP all while you wait for your food.

I will definitely go there again.","delta.star":1,"review.effect":"Positive","average.stars":"4","review.stars":"5","sentiment":0.166150351576972,"Topic 1":0.00752219586306816,"Topic 2":0.0719999656965721,"Topic 3":0.0162266102342449,"Topic 4":0.0659820533379011,"Topic 5":0.0193992446662009,"Topic 6":0.023856480755119,"Topic 7":0.521144880378546,"Topic 8":0.0347861125619772,"Topic 9":0.147842478412395,"Topic 10":0.0102582501139302,"Topic 11":0.0225350687569748,"Topic 12":0.0124392190592025,"Topic 13":0.00773093734184344,"Topic 14":0.0125508660779899,"Topic 15":0.0257256367440345},{"id":242,"body":"This is the location that my family frequents. It's not perfect but it's good enough for me. We have at least 3 or more visits each year for some kids birthdays though we don't opt to celebrate them there per say. We have taken cake and presents there without purchasing a party pack and had no problems. As far as I know, as long as you pay for food you can have access to the restrooms, tables, and games. You don't have to purchase a party pack or reservation to celebrate a birthday here.\n\nLocation and Seating: This place is a lot bigger than some other PPP's we have went to and there are plenty of tables. They could be spaced a little more apart, though. They have booths in the side walls where small families or single visitors can stay. Would be a nice place to take a laptop to do some work if you don't mind the average noise. Kids playing and the games making noise isn't bothersome- it's at a pretty average volume. They do have music playing so if you don't mind the latest hits playing it's cool\n\nRestrooms: Are not squeaky clean but also not filthy.\n\nGames: This location has a fair amount of games and has more than some other locations I've been to. I always wish there were more as usually 2-3 games are out of order. The location is quite large, they could use some more ticket dispensing games. They have racing games, claw machines, skee ball, basketball and more. Plenty to keep the kids occupied. There is almost always a person around to help if a machine doesn't give you your tickets or eats your token. On our last visit a few new games were set up like Deal or No Deal. A big plus.\n\nFood: I know people always knock on the pizza taste but I don't mind it. I do think that the prices could be lower. The supreme pizza is my favorite. I am not a big fan of the wings but they are definitely NOT dry. You can refill your drink as many times as you want. Salad is pretty good. They also offers ice cream cones for $.99. The wait for the pizza is average. Not fast but not super long either.\n\nOverall a pretty good location. We have never had a bad experience here.","delta.star":0.5,"review.effect":"Positive","average.stars":"3.5","review.stars":"4","sentiment":0.419629148694618,"Topic 1":0.049090880930732,"Topic 2":0.32790021633598,"Topic 3":0.294932624336615,"Topic 4":0.00215525487749932,"Topic 5":0.0420103521704758,"Topic 6":0.0176916582759725,"Topic 7":0.0839524637579279,"Topic 8":0.0537084190313509,"Topic 9":0.00289692623289878,"Topic 10":0.00309208716976731,"Topic 11":0.0806624362242051,"Topic 12":0.00780683372723402,"Topic 13":0.00585387996350721,"Topic 14":0.0122413070665231,"Topic 15":0.0160046598993113},{"id":243,"body":"Cheap chinese buffets are my favorite type of \"Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives\" to seek out and enjoy; a little bit of risk can sometimes bring a great reward. Other times..., well, it's a gamble that either pays off or it doesn't -- hopefully you don't pay too dearly! \n\nChina Harvest is one of the good finds, but it takes a very specific taste (ie cheap) to fully enjoy a dining experience there. The restaurant is housed in a former Denny's restaurant building, in a Food City shopping center at 28th Ave and Cactus in North Phoenix, and with its sloping, tiled roof, really looks like an old chinese building. They added a bright green, almost chartreuse, interior paint-job and stuck compact fluorescent light bulbs in all of the booth's fixtures to spruce up the place and make it their own, creating quite a trailer-chic ambiance. \n\nChina Harvest has been in this location for a long time, and is almost always moderately busy. It seems to be a family-run operation, since the same workers are always there whether I go for a late dinner or an early weekday lunch (insert Labor Law joke here). In several years of coming here, I've never gotten personal with the staff, but they are always polite, recognize me as a regular customer, and are even occasionally cheerful, if reserved. Cleanliness is okay, but the place is OLD, so maintains a pretty dumpy facade. \n\nIf you can get past the decor, China Harvest does make some pretty good 'american-style' chinese food. All of the staples are there, such as S&S chicken, fried rice, noodles, egg rolls, etc. They also include some items that are not always found, but that I appreciate, such as spinach, bean sprouts, and other veggies. I am not a seafood fan, but they always have plenty of choices, from stuffed crab to shrimp to mussels, which my wife and daughter enjoy a lot. I've even seen folks 'sucking the heads' of a pile of crayfish. I usually stick with the several varieties of chicken dishes, such as spicy General Tso's, sweet honey-sesame, or teriyaki chicken, and the BBQ pork as well. There are plenty of generic dessert choices to choose from including soft serve ice cream, fruit, cakes, and there's always room for Jello. \n\nMy only concerns are that a lot of the dishes are cooked using a deep fryer, and sometimes the temperature or draining must not be quite right and the items are a little on the wrong side of the GREASY-CRISPY Spectrum. On those days, the food quality combined with the environment would only warrant about 2.5 stars. If this could be remedied to at least be consistent, or better yet if there were more dishes prepared by grilling, woking, or baking, I would enjoy the food even more. \nAlso, there are no toppings available for the ice cream, just a standard soft serve machine with VAN - SWIRL - CHOC and a choice of a dish or a cone. I get around this by adding some of the bananas with fake strawberry sauce from the salad area of the buffet, but some chocolate syrup and nuts would be even better. \n\nA nice choice for lunch is to take advantage of paying by the pound to get it to go. You get to load up however much you like and pay for that much -- lunch to go for me is usually around $3-5, which can save over the All-You-Can-Eat price if you don't have a big appetite that day. I don't like this on days when I want a ton of food, though; then it's better to go to a one-price per box place. \n\nChina Harvest may only be a 3 star joint to most folks, but it is right up my alley as a low cost, decent quality, cheapo china 'booofay'.","delta.star":1,"review.effect":"Positive","average.stars":"3","review.stars":"4","sentiment":0.442498105537604,"Topic 1":0.162656773743342,"Topic 2":0.238505064219844,"Topic 3":0.0328109392844763,"Topic 4":0.0307136258101465,"Topic 5":0.0495254722913617,"Topic 6":0.0375245000342889,"Topic 7":0.0775223309603979,"Topic 8":0.00292350189837502,"Topic 9":0.238636195021127,"Topic 10":0.006208367789158,"Topic 11":0.0198326135255534,"Topic 12":0.0335466602345214,"Topic 13":0.0125655963421054,"Topic 14":0.0131116316703068,"Topic 15":0.0439167271749952},{"id":244,"body":"Yeah! A five star for a restaurant that yet is part of a chain. It became to Nun's island because it tasted like venturing bixi. It is fairly central and super accessible.

We went without a reservation and even if it was full, the luck was on our side and it has been sitting in just 5 minutes.\n\nThe food was good.

Perfect to take only the portion need you :)\n\nThe main reason for the five stars is for the service. Absolutely amazing with zero claim. We had the impression throughout the evening to be served by proud people from their jobs who have hearts with their client. Even asking directions to the bathroom answer us with a huge smile! A lady at a table near ours was very dramatic (big blow of fists on table, she spoke loud, etc.) and so apologizing for his behavior, and because it looked to have a good night, it took us free dessert bites. Also, the time leave between each step of the meal was always perfect. At the end, not even need to wait too long for the addition.\n\nIt was an evening perfect for me, and I was very pleased and especially surprised to love this Steak Frites St-Paul as much!

It was excellent and again plenty of food for 2 people. \n\nThe staff are great and very attentive to their customers.","delta.star":2,"review.effect":"Positive","average.stars":"3","review.stars":"5","sentiment":0.398711450707234,"Topic 1":0.0138645142176808,"Topic 2":0.051223702999464,"Topic 3":0.40848419233444,"Topic 4":0.00605857399709234,"Topic 5":0.118855798512143,"Topic 6":0.0115827973416335,"Topic 7":0.192301480404452,"Topic 8":0.0308657481471205,"Topic 9":0.00750821640215517,"Topic 10":0.00437709815085576,"Topic 11":0.0353714651335292,"Topic 12":0.0189636430695843,"Topic 13":0.0232869275949997,"Topic 14":0.0567823450908891,"Topic 15":0.0204734966039601},{"id":253,"body":"This is a well-managed IHOP that can get pretty busy on weekend mornings.

The owner and his wife were extremely hospitable. The owner is also a professional musician. At the time the patronage was light, three customers. One of the customers said he played the violin, so the owner let him play his, and he hauled out an electronic piano and the two gave an informal concert on the spot.

We ordered 3 different meals, lomo a caballo, arroz con mariscos, and pollo a la brasa.  The lomo a caballo would have been pretty good, but the sauce they had was sweet, which I didn't like at all.  The arroz con mariscos was bland, hardly any flavor.  The pollo a la brasa was far from the real deal, being dry and unflavorful.  we did get a free soup with our meal, which was the best thing we tasted there.  The sodas tasted like there was dish soap in them, and were not refilled until I finally had to ask.  We also had to ask for the sauces for the pollo a la brasa.  The aji that was served with the bread was pretty decent, but not enough to save the rest of the meal.  Overall, it was too pricey for the service and the quality of the food.  Sadly, we haven't been able to find a Peruvian restaurant that we like in AZ, and this one was probably the worst one we've tried.\n\nWow! It's a good thing you can edit these reviews.  A lot has happened since I made this review, which the last time I checked is an opinion of what I think.  The owner of this restaurant, upon reading my review, posted it on \"Peruanos en Arizona,\" a group on Facebook.  He mentioned my full name in the review, opening it up to his \"friends\" to personally attack me.  He also said that that I went in to his restaurant complaining of the decoration of his restaurant. (which I didn't).   My wife made some comments, defending our opinion, and then he scanned our yelp coupon (which has my full name on it,) and order sheet that was made when we paid, and posted it on the same page as a picture, claiming that he was right about me making comments about the decoration. (which is not shown in the picture.) He claims to be a professional, but is far from it.  I had nothing against him personally, until now, but in one of his comments he says that there is no possible way that so many things can be wrong with his food unless I have something personal against him.  I don't think I need drive to a place and pay for a meal to make a review on someone who I personally don't like. He also posted the same review on his personal facebook page, to which his \"friends\" responded things like, \"poor gringo, he only knows what frozen hamburgers and hot dogs taste like\" and \"He doesn't have the smallest idea of what real Peruvian Food is, he probably hasn't even been there,\" \"with a last name like that, what does he know,\" \"He's one of 'those' customers\", \"I hope the seafood got him sick,\"  words like jealous, ignorant... things like that.  Now if I didn't know any better, I would think that a gringo's opinion doesn't matter when it comes to real Peruvian food, too.  However, I HAVE been to Peru, I DO know what good Peruvian food is supposed to taste like, and my wife, who is actually FROM Peru was equally disappointed with the food, and service.  Her mother cooks 50 times better than this guy, and we both know that what we ate doesn't compare to what real Peruvian food is supposed to be.  So, instead of taking this as constructive criticism, the owner has taken it as a personal attack against him, and has to look for validation from other people who surround him.  We probably would have been back there again, because my wife's family would have wanted to try the \"new Peruvian restaurant\" which has happened before with others, but now no one that we can tell to about our experience will ever go there.  There are also many many many other sites to review a restaurant, not just Yelp.  I'll make sure to put this same review on other sites, too.  That will also give me time to think up other things that I didn't like that I didn't mention on my original review.  Like how this \"professional\" was negotiating delivery prices with a meat driver right in front of the guests.  When I made this review, Yelp posted it on my facebook page, but I took it down because it was negative, but I will be sure to post it now.  I don't know if what this guy did was legal, but I'll find out soon enough.  I just hope he doesn't put my Debit Card number up on facebook.  So, if you're going to give this place a negative review, watch out!  You'll be personally attacked for your OPINION, and be lied about and be told you don't know what you're talking about.  He has since taken down all his posts, but I saved all the screenshots if anyone is interested.","delta.star":-3,"review.effect":"Negative","average.stars":"4","review.stars":"1","sentiment":0.0792854181156493,"Topic 1":0.00330875242019198,"Topic 2":0.0835683221179925,"Topic 3":0.00732859847113888,"Topic 4":0.0784581596120569,"Topic 5":0.00687826494947203,"Topic 6":0.331484595030828,"Topic 7":0.0242000388175805,"Topic 8":0.00505108096189041,"Topic 9":0.00844187261482229,"Topic 10":0.036137745330872,"Topic 11":0.309057596937286,"Topic 12":0.0158036308383106,"Topic 13":0.0171855076819491,"Topic 14":0.00543795918894502,"Topic 15":0.0676578750266637},{"id":271,"body":"This new Sam Fox restaurant opens on November 24 (OK, so they DO have one in Tucson, but it's new to us). We had the privilege of going to a Pre-Opening dinner to benefit the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. Essentially, all of the money we paid to attend went to CFF and Blanco essentially gave us an open tab at their restaurant. It was a complete dry run, so the entire menu was in play! \n\nFirst off, very friendly staff. We had to wait about 20 minutes for our table, but the bar was lively and, while crowded, it was still easy to stand around and enjoy your drink, with the house DJ also keeping the mood buzzing. If we had wanted to \"hover\" for a couch, their patio is filled with big blue couches and fire-pits, facing Scottsdale road. Their full menu is served on the patio (as well as the bar), but we decided that we'd wait for a booth inside. \n\nOnce seated, or server made sure we were all set on drinks and walked us through the menu. We started by sharing a Roasted Chicken and Poblano Chile Crisp, which is essentially a little Mexican pizza. For a main course, I enjoyed the Fish Tacos, while the Seared Ahi Tacos and the Beef Enchiladas also graced our table. Not exactly earth shattering dining concepts, but there wasn't a bite of food left when it was all over. \n\nFor desert, our server recommended that we try THREE different desserts, so we went with the Tres Leche (kind of an oat-ish interpretation, but good!), the Caramel Flan (excellent! and probably the largest hunk of flan I'd ever seen!) and finally, the Rich Chocolate Cake (very dense and a bit too chocolaty, even for me). \n\nAll in all, a good meal, but what rockets this rating to 4-stars instead of a possible 3 were the margaritas. All the juices are fresh and they aren't too tart OR too sweet. And, while you didn't necessarily realize it by taste, there was enough tequila in them to put down a small horse. By my second margarita, there was no way I was driving home.

Not to mention the creamy scoop of vanilla ice cream you can get with it.\n\nThe only thing holding me back from tacking on five stars is that it is a little pricey for some items, but then again, it's not fast food.  Also, wait for your food is a little strange, especially when you're with a party.  Not everyone's dishes come out all at once.  \n\nGreat all around comfort food in a comfy setting.  It's a nice getaway from the job, that's for sure.","delta.star":0,"review.effect":"Neutral","average.stars":"4","review.stars":"4","sentiment":0.156170626299246,"Topic 1":0.0520551961310382,"Topic 2":0.124386125957762,"Topic 3":0.0152582002880019,"Topic 4":0.0302330806328641,"Topic 5":0.0261928987645695,"Topic 6":0.0744812928595234,"Topic 7":0.0707018518215071,"Topic 8":0.00784290531846825,"Topic 9":0.0834569512407167,"Topic 10":0.00754418291264067,"Topic 11":0.121980049775917,"Topic 12":0.237962732483465,"Topic 13":0.0343919872172058,"Topic 14":0.0128934498628078,"Topic 15":0.100619094733512},{"id":278,"body":"Fantastic patio with great live music and half price bottles of wine on Wednesdays....this all equals a great girls night out.  \n\nI need to rave about the service...I don't frequent the South Park area often because to be honest I feel uncomfortable in a lot of the restaurants.

China Buffet just opened on Independence Blvd where an old Olive Garden used to be.  It can be a little tricky to get to, but it's worth the stop.  They've made some HUGE improvements inside and out, giving it a beautiful, modern appearance.  The restaurant was very clean inside, and a lot of details were put into the decor and dining rooms.  The most imaginative is the entrance to the restaurant where it looks/feels like you're standing underneath a starlit evening sky.  The doorway leading into the restaurant rivals PF Chang's as well.\n\nThe food offerings were pretty extensive and flavorful.  I sampled several items and nowhere near tried even a quarter of the items on the multiple buffet tables.  There's something for everyone, including kids who may be fussy about foods.  The sushi offerings were greater than most Chinese buffets; there were more unique offerings than the traditional California roll.  And I didn't even get to touch the big salad bar or the made-to-order Hibachi option!  \n\nThe price was pretty reasonable for dinner, too, considering all of the items that China Buffet had to offer.

We're up to our ears in burgers people! Located in the now defunct El Pollo Loco in the Target East Valley strip mall, is the latest burger joint to focus on flame grilled burgers with various topping options at their topping bar. When you walk in, the place has a diner look complete with umbrellas. Flame Burger uses Niman meats, now I know some of you that know me, know that I am a vegetarian so how the hell is a vegetarian reviewing a burger shop? lol Well they had a veggie burger thank you so I could eat there, and my partner eats meat. Anyway back to the story err... review. According to their website, Niman Ranch is composed of small U.S. family farmers who are dedicated to raising their livestock under \"the strictest protocols,\" using \"humane animal raising standards\" to make the best tasting products. \n\nThe animals raised \"naturally\" means: never given hormones or antibiotics (ever for reals), fed a 100% vegetarian diet (me??), raised outdoors on pasture or in deeply bedded pens. \"Humane animal care\" means: livestock is raised outdoors, livestock always have access to fresh, clean water, and livestock are able to express their natural behaviors. Translation--Tasty meat. \n\nFood: (all their sandwiches are named with the word 'Flame' in front of them') Like we're at the forefronts of hell and this is the devil's choice of sandwich or something. Like I already mentioned they offer a veggie burger, they also offer a turkey burger, chicken sandwich, gyros, salads (Greek, Caesar, Garden, Flame), kids meals, breakfast burritos, Ciabatta sandwiches, cheesecake, flan, Chicago Red Hot dogs and sausages. They use waffle fries but also offer chili fries. No alcohol, only soda  sorry guys.\n\nPricing: About the same as most fast food joints-$5.00 for the Original Flame (includes burger, fries, and what appeared to be a large drink), $5-7 for all other combo meals including the other meat options, doubles, dogs and gyros. Single sandwiches $3-5 (incl. doubles), break burritos $3-4, Ciabatta sandwiches $3-4, kids meals are $3 and dogs range from $2-4. Altogether pretty affordable. Our total after tax that left us very full was $14.19.\n\nPros for me-if they can make a veggie burger taste like a real burger, they're all right in my book. The bun was toasted and grilled, they use a nicely textured patty that tasted like a turkey burger not with all that chunky crap I don't like, the fries were crispy and salty. I felt dirty eating this meal like a regular carnivore, instead of light and airy. I felt like I should be eating this in a seedy motel before returning home to my wife and trying to explain away the burger essence.\n\nMy partner said his burger was \"groin-grabbingly good!\" jeez way to embarrass me honey, now I have to write that on Yelp. They offered excellent friendly service even though I showed up in my oversized, red nerd glasses with my \"I'm a hot mess\" with the pancakes and the melting butter graphic on it t-shirt on. They still smiled at me. \nThere is ample seating and plenty of outside seating even though it is still too warm to do so at this time of year. \n\nCons-too greasy like all burger meals to eat often. This place needs better signage since it is hidden away in a rambling strip mall that doesn't really have that many businesses in it. They do not offer cheddar as a cheese. \n\nSide note: This place just opened this week, also has drive-thru.","delta.star":1.5,"review.effect":"Positive","average.stars":"2.5","review.stars":"4","sentiment":0.421124317921624,"Topic 1":0.070283993248437,"Topic 2":0.0958714689569394,"Topic 3":0.048468466170636,"Topic 4":0.00293901587098969,"Topic 5":0.0189504659797749,"Topic 6":0.0509389447926121,"Topic 7":0.0436115457317605,"Topic 8":0.00413288075727986,"Topic 9":0.0121457641387847,"Topic 10":0.0385035236303166,"Topic 11":0.0698835575828455,"Topic 12":0.0671950932081484,"Topic 13":0.282508552355461,"Topic 14":0.126074009338297,"Topic 15":0.0684927182377165},{"id":281,"body":"This eatery opened on November 15th.

Everyone in that office park seems to eat there daily, and the parking is awful.\n\nMy favorite on the menu is #48 - the Orchard salad with a standard bed of greens, chicken strips, oranges, apples, jicama, dried cranberries and walnuts, served with country French dressing (that I usually switch out for their Roasted Red Pepper Fat Free dressing, just so save those extra calories). \n\nI've also used this place for catering before and for the price it's very economical and fast. They will drop off your order and set up a really awesome and professional salad bar complete with all the fixings - salad mix, nuts, cheeses, an assortment of dressings, turkey, ham, chicken, fruit, tortilla strips, etc. I've also used Cranberry Hills Catering for those last moment \"oh no I forgot to order lunch and the meeting is in 4 hours from now\" situations. They've saved the day for me countless times!\n\nI wouldn't go out of my way to get their food for just an individual order. I mainly recommend this place for catering in addition to those last minute office lunch emergencies. They are fast and convenient if you work in the Mid-town Phoenix area.\n\nSince they don't have it on here, this is a link to their Web site http://bit.ly/cLvlvG","delta.star":-0.5,"review.effect":"Negative","average.stars":"3.5","review.stars":"3","sentiment":0.242555306694651,"Topic 1":0.173156167723822,"Topic 2":0.150937684106267,"Topic 3":0.0348660553751756,"Topic 4":0.00439063563087557,"Topic 5":0.0127553755185252,"Topic 6":0.0254339672223365,"Topic 7":0.0648064276912934,"Topic 8":0.0462745269251767,"Topic 9":0.0314755177992557,"Topic 10":0.00953161558750312,"Topic 11":0.0438983451046775,"Topic 12":0.020958808103476,"Topic 13":0.00851158228348743,"Topic 14":0.361846866195399,"Topic 15":0.0111564247327294},{"id":289,"body":"It is rare that I venture to the East of Mont-Royal Street.

If anything, the only complaint that I had was that I wished the crab cakes were bigger because I loved them so much!  The servers were excellent and friendly as well as the bartenders, one of which is from the same island I grew up on in the Lowcountry and was happy to \"chew the fat\" with me when he had few minutes.  Louis, the owner, even took a few minutes out of his busy schedule when he heard I was from Charleston and chatted with me.  I can't wait to take my family there when they come to visit!\n\nP.S.

We had hoped to try Toqu\u00e9! but they were closed both nights we were in town. Europea was open and we were able to get reservations, so we decided to give it a try. The restaurant has an elegant interior, and the night we were there it was mostly a business crowd, so we felt slightly underdressed. We both got the chef's tasting menu with wine pairings. The menu is inspired by Qu\u00e9bec's fresh produce. Presentation was excellent on all of the dishes; if I hadn't been to a place like this before I would have been more impressed, but we were a little underwhelmed as we've had better in LA (most recently at Gordon Ramsay), especially for the price. But it was still very good. As best as I can remember, our courses were as follows:\n\nAmuse bouche: goat cheese mousse with risotto and bacon\nLobster cream cappuccino with truffle oil\nPrincess scallops, prepared in the shell with morel mushroom milk, sea water emulsion, parsnip pur\u00e9e\nDuo of pan seared and torchon foie gras\nLight C02 foam prepared with C\u00e9sar salad\nSurf & turf (medallion of milk fed veal with a crust of herbs pesto, langoustine ravioli with confit tomatoes, saut\u00e9ed girolles mushrooms\nCheese plate\n2 dessert courses\n\nThe desserts were extremely elaborate. Our first dessert course included panna cotta and a huge 3-tiered tray of bite-sized desserts, including maple marshmallow, chocolate-covered orange rind, chocolate-covered strawberries, apricot jelly pistachio tart, etc. Our second dessert course included a chocolate pot de cr\u00e8me with espresso foam and butterscotch ice cream.\n\nProbably my favorite dishes were the scallops and the langoustines, and my least favorite was the veal, which was slightly overcooked for our more bloody tastes. Foam was used in several dishes (it is molecular gastronomy after all), which may be a little gimmicky but I'm not complaining - actually the caesar salad foam dish was fairly interesting, and the foam that came with the scallops was an excellent complement. For our cheese course a large table of cheeses was brought out, from which we got to choose 4, so we chose all of the local Qu\u00e9bec cheeses that they offered. The wine pairings were somewhat uninspired in our opinion, but we did enjoy the Barolo that was served with our surf & turf course, and I appreciated that they served a local Canadian sweet wine with the foie gras course rather than the traditional Sauternes. There were only 4 wines served with the 9 courses, which on the one hand comes across as not enough, but on the other hand it was nice to still be fairly sober at the end of the meal.  \n\nPersonally I don't need to go back anytime soon, but it was a good dinner overall, and it seemed like a good place for a business dinner or a date if you've got money to spend.","delta.star":-0.5,"review.effect":"Negative","average.stars":"4.5","review.stars":"4","sentiment":0.480599798071104,"Topic 1":0.104393066111639,"Topic 2":0.0291949005918123,"Topic 3":0.0202146312079608,"Topic 4":0.00486158536239331,"Topic 5":0.579244552419701,"Topic 6":0.0249851967333994,"Topic 7":0.0667415640698407,"Topic 8":0.0250932549746017,"Topic 9":0.00298031544434582,"Topic 10":0.00147219802291636,"Topic 11":0.0278043888715387,"Topic 12":0.0673663054953303,"Topic 13":0.00448725896305783,"Topic 14":0.0103888492955308,"Topic 15":0.0307719324359314},{"id":313,"body":"This place was so new that the location is not even on their company website, but I gladly accepted their opening special - a 'Nutella' filled rolled crepe for $1.99 + tax, for my perfect afternoon snack. \n\nI imagine it will do for an in between class snack for the nearby Concordia student population.

This place did just about everything it could think of to make me wish I never used an iphone app to find it. \n\nI went to Vegas this weekend to enjoy UFC 106 with some close friends. After Forrest Griffin made me happy I decided to top off the evening with something like The boiling Crab or the Crab hut. I used my friend's iPhone to find the nearest spot for us to indulge in some Cajun goodness. We got in a cab and hurried over to Cajun Crawfish. We arrived to find the place almost empty. We were sat and the waiter returned with our drinks. We ordered our usual and waited for about 15 minutes only to have the waiter return to our table to tell us they were out of corn on the cob....whaaaat?? ok ok ok...I can deal with that. But then we waited about another 30 minutes only to be confronted with the most flavorless crawfish and shrimp I have ever tasted in my life! Our potatoes come and they have no seasoning anywhere and are waaay undercooked. We sent the potatoes back to be cooked longer and they were still under cooked when the waiter brought them back. We ordered some steamed white rice and even that was horrible....how do you screw up rice? The sausage was undercooked, the crawfish was over cooked and lacked any flavor except spice. the shrimp was ok at best...a tad over cooked but still...ok. We tried to tell the female waitress about the potatoes and the rice only to find she doesn't speak English, so we were then stuck playing charades with the girl. After we were finished with our disaster of a dinner...we asked for wet naps. The lemon scented ones tend to cut the fishy smell out of your hands. Guess what?? No wet naps. \n\nWe agreed to call it quits for the evening and head back to the hotel. We asked the waiter to call a cab.....after asking every employee in the joint \"Do we have cab number?\" we decided to make use of the iphone once again and called our own cab. \n\nWe waited outside for our cab and noticed the sign for Cajun Crawfish stated \"Grand Opening\". Well, I don't know about \"grand\" but I guess the place is new. So here is my advice to the owners....shut down for a week and visit The Boiling Crab in LA area. Notice the flavor, the decor, the hospitable service, the flavor and the flavor or their food. Then come back to Vegas and regroup. There is no point in owning a below average establishment like this. When you have visitors that know what their food is supposed to taste like and visit your restaurant with certain expectations....they are just going to leave seriously unhappy and are going to tell all their friends about their piss poor experience. Not trying to be mean...but Cajun Crawfish is way under par. \n\nCajun Crawfish failed to deliver...in EVERY way possible. I will not go back and I will make sure that no one I care about makes the same mistake I did by going here. Waste of time, waste of money and there was a risk of food poisoning with the whole undercooked sausage thing. It's clear this place doesn't care about the quality of their food....looks like they are just happy enough to be open and have anyone walk through their doors. \n\n2 lb shrimp (1 mild and 1 medium) FAIL \n2 lb Crawfish (medium) FAIL \n12 practically raw potatoes FAIL \nno corn on the cob MAJOR FAIL \n24 undercooked sausage FAIL \n3 orders of slice bread GOOD \n2 order rice FAIL \n\nI would have been happier with Popeye's Chicken and Biscuits","delta.star":-2,"review.effect":"Negative","average.stars":"3","review.stars":"1","sentiment":-0.110401213444667,"Topic 1":0.0050780788521614,"Topic 2":0.027497842331639,"Topic 3":0.0154949147925949,"Topic 4":0.0137034488374166,"Topic 5":0.033282708669303,"Topic 6":0.300675296063227,"Topic 7":0.0146667495831072,"Topic 8":0.0256272388161635,"Topic 9":0.0612962773806694,"Topic 10":0.00260004220702519,"Topic 11":0.275523679255776,"Topic 12":0.177824489196593,"Topic 13":0.00795512071699553,"Topic 14":0.00430338108908107,"Topic 15":0.0344707322082466},{"id":325,"body":"What an awesome and friendly place to hang out!

It was each of our first time there and we were actually pretty impressed.  It reminded me of a diner-type of feel - old school Mexican (Sonoran style I believe).   Very festive, and with this location's open air facility, it was refreshing.  (Not sure what it would be like on a summer night though!)\n\nOur server was really attentive and sweet.  We tried not to fill up on chips and salsa - always a challenge at Mexican restaurants and this was no exception.  Their salsa was fairly mild but delicious!  For our entrees, I had the shrimp fajitas while one friend had the veggie fajitas and another had chicken soft tacos.  Servings are pretty big - and everything we ordered came with rice and beans.\n\nMy shrimp fajitas were sered in a spicy sauce that wasn't amazing... or maybe there was just too much of it.  Next time, I'll go with the veggie or perhaps chicken fajitas instead.  We were all too full for dessert... The total with everything i mentioned plus a beer and a diet coke came to $47 and change.  Not cheap but not crazy expensive.  Luckily, we had a $50 gift card; always a bonus!\n\nOverall, good Mexican experience - family friendly, attentive service, good food, easy parking situation, etc.... I'm sure I'll be back.  \n\nHasta la proxima vez, Julio G!","delta.star":0.5,"review.effect":"Positive","average.stars":"3.5","review.stars":"4","sentiment":0.48587676093033,"Topic 1":0.00982937988678066,"Topic 2":0.164707821635652,"Topic 3":0.0867633149715184,"Topic 4":0.0145727050843973,"Topic 5":0.0346840326570708,"Topic 6":0.0189531145902883,"Topic 7":0.170894614358729,"Topic 8":0.00437592259503848,"Topic 9":0.0692268563920319,"Topic 10":0.252499594754599,"Topic 11":0.0984069743689189,"Topic 12":0.0278770067572533,"Topic 13":0.0113679970896183,"Topic 14":0.0072734363356055,"Topic 15":0.028567228522498},{"id":329,"body":"I have eaten at this location a few times and the food was good (oysters & shrimp poppers yum, yum!), the service was fine and the beer was cold - what more can you ask for?","delta.star":0,"review.effect":"Neutral","average.stars":"3","review.stars":"3","sentiment":0,"Topic 1":0.0233629429811043,"Topic 2":0.211948731773865,"Topic 3":0.0867575047203663,"Topic 4":0.0291114133208865,"Topic 5":0.065651935752188,"Topic 6":0.146986461723403,"Topic 7":0.0897277812429143,"Topic 8":0.0151703894212074,"Topic 9":0.0507846774893514,"Topic 10":0.0156209891097777,"Topic 11":0.0990274563004681,"Topic 12":0.0349084062805326,"Topic 13":0.0659008772039225,"Topic 14":0.0264442463344918,"Topic 15":0.0385961863455212},{"id":330,"body":"Awesome time at the Med Grill!

Med Grill is the one of the places that plays a good mix of hip hop music.

We thought we had missed the hotel since we were driving along for awhile.\n\nLoews Las Vegas is a hidden gem of a resort and I'm glad we found ourselves there.  \n\nTheir Restaurant Week menu offered you a choice among two starters, two entrees, and two desserts.  Luckily, the Big F and I agree on one really important thing, and that's food.  We easily decided to try the whole menu.  Just as we were about to put in our order, our waiter came by and told us they were out of hamachi.  That definitely put a damper on things and we looked over what we could substitute with hamachi.  As we perused over all the different rolls and sushi, the waiter came back and said they found more!  Yay!  \n\nService continued being a little quirky when steak knives soon appeared and an entr\u00e9e consisting of beef arrived in front of me.  When a second steak showed up in front of the Big F, we knew something was wrong.  We motioned to a waiter (not our original one), and told him we didn't think these were our entrees.  Our waiter swiftly took them away (as they were $100 pieces of steak)!  Then the Big F noticed some discussion going on at a nearby table and had a feeling that they received our starters.  Indeed, that is what happened!  All was sorted out and we finally got our meal! \n\nStarters, choice of:\n\n* Sashimi Trio \"cajun seared albacore, garlic ponzu sauce; togarashi seared tuna yuzu miso sauce; and yellowtail asian pico del gallo\" - Two pieces of sashimi each and what makes this fish different is their unique and complementing sauces.  They had us scooping up all the sauce we could!\n\nor\n\n* Sushi Sampler \"4 pieces hamachi verde: (yellowtail, scallions, Thai chilis topped with cilantro, and thinly sliced limes) and 2 pieces temari scallop (slices of tuna around spicy sea scallops with wasabi flying fish roe and wasabi aioli).\" - The hamachi verde is a refreshing sushi roll with the lime slices, but it's the temari scallop roll that was the real winner.  We really enjoyed the scallop and wasabi aioli, it had us wanting more!\n\nEntrees, choice of:\n\n* Miso Braised Kobe Short Rib \"shiitake mushrooms, grilled asparagus, crisp maui onions\" - One of their most popular dishes, and you can easily see why.  The morsels of meat were gently braised and quite delicious.  The buttery mashed potatoes were just fattening and oh-so good!  A heavy dish indeed!\n\nor \n\n* Opakapaka Lau Lau \"coconut ginger cream, kobocha squash and banana chutney.\" - Beautifully presented where they 'release' the banana leaves to showcase the hidden secrets that lay within.  I'm not one for cooked fish, but this was extraordinary.  Not dry at all, and the sweetness from the banana chutney adds a completely new dimension to it.  I would go back and order this again for sure!\n\nDesserts, choice of:\n\n* Chocolate Lava Cake - A molten center with lovely sauces and fresh berries that come with it.\n\n or \n\n*Asian Pear Tart - Oh my gawd delicious.  So good that it's not worth sharing.  The tart is flaky and light, and the asian pears are sweet and just perfect.  And the sauces that come with it only add to the happy hum in your mouth.  Worth driving out this way just for a slice of heaven.  It's definitely one of my favorite desserts ever.  You probably saw me licking the plate!\n\nOur waiter forgot that we ordered the sake flight, a sampling of four sakes ($19).  And when we told him midway through our meal that he could just forget about it, he decided instead to give it to us complimentary!  The four samples included \"shirakaberuga junmai, dewazakura \"oka\", hoyo \"fair maiden\", and creme de sake.\"  \n\nWe did notice that it was hard to find our waiter and it looked understaffed.  When we had a chance to chat with the waiter later on, he did confirm that it was understaffed that night, which definitely explains the mix-up with all the food.\n\nDespite all the weird service, I'd give Marssa a 4.5.  (I'm sure it would be a solid 5 during our return visit.  We're told we have to try their Dinner for Two Sushi Platters created by Master Sushi Chef Osama \"Fuji\" Fujita!)  Master Fuji was actually on hand when we left so we got to say hi too!  With him being the ONLY master sushi chef in Nevada, how can you resist not sitting in front of him?\n\nBut if we don't go for sushi, I'd definitely return for their other entrees instead.  This is one of my top choices for a nice date restaurant!\n\n(And you know pics are posted of this fabulous dinner!)\n\nUpdate! 12/08 - Returned for another fabulous visit.

Wendy's has now been opened for a week. Funny thing is that we didn't order any noodle dishes. Here is what we had: \n\nChicken wings for an appetizer \nCube Beef with Rice \nBaked Pork Chop over Rice \nMango Tapioca for dessert \n\nThe rice dishes come with soup of the day. The soup of the day is a Chinese home style rib broth which we often crave. Not your typical Egg Flower soup that Westerners seem to like. This is Chinese home style. \n\nThe chicken wings were deep fried in a very light batter sprinkled with dried garlic and some chili peppers. Very tasty but the wings were a bit on the small side. \n\nThe Baked Pork Chop and Cube Beef dishes are very tasty. My favorite was the fried rice that came with the Pork Chop entree. The Cubed Beef was very tender and juicy. The one thing I wished they would have on the menu is a Hong Kong cafe style baked pork chop over spaghetti dish or other style of baked pastas that you find in Hong Kong style cafes in LA. If you are going to have the word \"Noodle\" in your name, I would expect more noodle type offerings.\n\nFinally, for the dessert, we had the Mango Tapioca. It came with several chunks of mangoes, but was strangely laced with grapefruit. I am not a big fan of sweet and bitter desserts. \n\nI will be bringing my parents here for our Sunday lunch. \n\nEDIT: Brought my parents for Sunday lunch.

Also, the noodle wasn't served piping hot. \n\nThe two chicken rice dishes were good. HOWEVER, we were very disappointed in the BBQ Pork over Rice dish. The BBQ Pork was not fresh and was a bit dry; what a disappointment to an otherwise wonderful first time experience. \n\nI'll still keep it a 4-star because the service is excellent and the complimentary soup with rice dishes is still a favorite.","delta.star":0,"review.effect":"Neutral","average.stars":"4","review.stars":"4","sentiment":0.0461362494818731,"Topic 1":0.0168114739558489,"Topic 2":0.0188265215267691,"Topic 3":0.00362789961759692,"Topic 4":0.256824496452223,"Topic 5":0.0290169255963412,"Topic 6":0.014832105727179,"Topic 7":0.0287429920525167,"Topic 8":0.0463624344755464,"Topic 9":0.291283593300141,"Topic 10":0.00117934114043792,"Topic 11":0.0119349033284214,"Topic 12":0.240008991309562,"Topic 13":0.00873731129322061,"Topic 14":0.00867476067766467,"Topic 15":0.0231362495465308},{"id":338,"body":"A Vietnamese vegetarian that does not pay mine...

The attentive staff that we encountered all sounded like they were fluent in Spanish.  The food is more Spanish than the Icon in downtown Madison.  We started by ordering the assorted Spanish olives and the waiter looked at us questioningly as if searching for the Spanish translation.  On the menu, they were called aceitunas alinadas.  We also tried almejas en salsa verde.  Clams in a green salsa.  The tasty clams had a clear mild sauce with tiny sweet onions on the plate.  Another combination tapas plate had a croquette with ham, chicken, cheeses and vegetables; a delicious albondiga, (meatball), which was made of beef, pork, and veal; serano ham and another type of thinly sliced Spanish sausage, most likely chorizo; and a potato and tuna salad.  The delicious paella vegetariana had fresh crispy vegetables with an al dente saffron rice.  We finished off with a desert, pera rellena, which was two pear halves, 2 strawberry halves over the top of a what I can describe as a mint white chocolate truffle, drizzled with chocolate syrup and a berry sauce.   \n\nTapas Rias is located in an older strip mall on Allen Blvd, but when you walk it the door, you will be surprised at how nice of a place they've created and brought to the Madison area.  You will be greeted by a stylish Spanish restaurant with warm colors and decor that fits the room. If I could give this 4 1/2 stars, I would.

Good things are happening with Buldogi's. Also, it needs to be said: this is run by some of the nicest people. They always take care of us and will have our business.\n\nAt the time of writing, it is in soft opening mode. Everything is half off. I think they close down this week around 2 or 3pm and only serve breakfast. I believe next week will be a lunch menu which includes more of their original menu from the Fort Apache location.\n\nIf you've been to Buldogi's before, you already will know their lunch menu. A mix of gourmet hot dogs with extravagant toppings, some bowls, burgers, and a hangover soup. You should look up the Fort Apache location to get the reviews on that menu. What's new is breakfast!\n\nYou've got an assortment of pancakes, waffles, french toast, and eggs. Sounds about right. There's even a Monte Cristo sandwich - which is French toast turned into a sandwich containing ham, turkey, eggs, and some jam. But then, the fusion starts.  The loco moco makes a comeback from the lunch menu, as well as the hangover soup. How about a mung bean pancake? Bulgogi and rice with eggs?\n\nWe took two of the new additions on the menu and one familiar hangover soup.\n\n- Mung bean kimchi pancake. This is served with rice, two eggs, a side dipping sauce for the pancake, and a little cup of chopped cucumber and tomato. The pancake tastes great! Definitely something we haven't had before. It's dense, savory, and can be filled with either a few vegetable slices or pork belly. There is a weird lack of kimchi despite it being in the title. In terms of flavors and eating enjoyment, this is excellent. For value, it is not high (at normal price). To me, $11 is steep for the pancake's small size,  but I don't know if this is the final word. Especially for the area, it's going to be a tough sell. In thinking of points for increasing value - adding banchan!\n\n- Monte Cristo French Toast. This is your ham and turkey sandwich, topped with eggs your way and made extra rich via French toasting the bread slices. The bread is cooked fluffy and flavorful, while the whole sandwich is generally served warm topped with (as requested) a liquid yolk. It is indulgent. Very, very indulgent and deliciously so. There is just no way you aren't going to love this. There is a side of jam with it but I didn't find it necessary. Again, for $10 it is a little bit steep for just the sandwich. A few chips or fries on the side will really complete this.\n\n- Hangover soup: we already love this soup. It's basically a chicken noodle soup from Korea with mung bean noodles (correct me if I'm wrong) and a spicy, flavorful broth. Some spinach leaves float around and enjoy the ambiance of the pulled chicken. If you haven't had it, you're missing out.\n\nService is in some ways the reverse of say, IHOP, where you eat and then bring your receipt to the register. You order/pay at the register and bring your number to the table. Your food will come out shortly! The new place is done up very nicely, especially for the area. Most things around here are just done on a tight budget.\n\nThey're still working on smoothing everything out so an update to this will surely come - but for the time being go get your preview of the new cafe!","delta.star":-0.5,"review.effect":"Negative","average.stars":"4.5","review.stars":"4","sentiment":0.257551179346711,"Topic 1":0.278985116466685,"Topic 2":0.0940217058651664,"Topic 3":0.00691324634054398,"Topic 4":0.120707060253435,"Topic 5":0.00814385319242033,"Topic 6":0.0190651242259533,"Topic 7":0.073109668020823,"Topic 8":0.00249352928216003,"Topic 9":0.0298934191105119,"Topic 10":0.0183397222961084,"Topic 11":0.0946603449204789,"Topic 12":0.0767004091086792,"Topic 13":0.0319971336775842,"Topic 14":0.121673895269671,"Topic 15":0.0232957719697792},{"id":346,"body":"Not the same Domino's pizza I ate too much of in College.

Sweet.\n\nUnfortunately, that is the absolute high point of the evening, other than the fact that they were close to where we were going.  The service actually blows.  It takes a long time to get someone to acknowledge that you are there.  It then takes even longer to get a table.  Then if you are lucky they might tell you that they will be with you in a minute while they clean the tables that look like they have been sitting there dirty since you walked in (while not actually taking your order).\n\nOnce your order is taken, it actually comes out fairly quickly - unfortunately there is almost no taste to it.  The problem appears to stem from the guy on the grill who is mashing those thin little burgers into smithereens, making them into something approaching shoe leather.  It would be nice if they had a bit of juice left to them perhaps.  If you try their seasoning it can help, but you are really just adding salt.","delta.star":-1,"review.effect":"Negative","average.stars":"3","review.stars":"2","sentiment":0,"Topic 1":0.0126123331258917,"Topic 2":0.168984711518583,"Topic 3":0.0260893722627692,"Topic 4":0.00370155645156916,"Topic 5":0.0112560791666134,"Topic 6":0.135031441667082,"Topic 7":0.0188560123866338,"Topic 8":0.0149035069643088,"Topic 9":0.00912280574597375,"Topic 10":0.0058839685582552,"Topic 11":0.43685921744251,"Topic 12":0.0696984780769401,"Topic 13":0.0579587861311739,"Topic 14":0.0124006940696497,"Topic 15":0.0166410364320456},{"id":352,"body":"I am really surprised that there are not more reviews for this great restaurant.  I am not a vegetarian by any means, but my dining partner is, so we had to give this place a try.  The location is half restaurant and half grocery store, specializing in Asian grocery and their homemade protein replacement concoctions.  Faux meat is something that I have never tried before, and it is their specialty here at Yuan.  Most dishes are offered as Chinese meals, as sushi, or in bento box form.\n\nWe both got bubble tea, because that is hard to pass up whenever available.  It comes shaken, not blended and most flavor are of the milk tea variety.\n\nThe sampler platter is what I ordered to try a little bit of everything.  I loved all of the items:\n-Fried Taro Roll- I am a huge fan of anything taro, so this was a treat for me.  Crispy on the outside and the inside filled with smooth potato-like taro.\n-Faux Duck- This was like little mini crispy duck legs, brushed with five spice honey and formed onto a wood skewer.  Tasted even better than the real thing to me because it still had all of the flavor, but less fat.\n-Faux Fried Chicken- this was fried sesame flavored nuggets of faux chicken, which was so close to the real thing, I do not know how anyone could tell the difference.  They also have a General Tso's Faux Chicken entr\u00e9e- this dish made me want to give that a try.\n-Mixed Rolls- 4 pieces  of mixed sushi rolls with fried stuff and veggies on the inside.  I don't know what it was, but it sure tasted good.  \n\nMy vegetarian friend ordered a sushi roll sampler that also included inari.  I tried some of her rolls and they were all very flavorful with great texture.  After eating at Yuan, you feel satisfied, but not gross or lethargic like after you eat meat.  We will definitely be coming back here next time we visit Montreal.","delta.star":1,"review.effect":"Positive","average.stars":"4","review.stars":"5","sentiment":0.177593133744345,"Topic 1":0.00714929192830889,"Topic 2":0.0538779163056312,"Topic 3":0.00633782782976635,"Topic 4":0.390609636568741,"Topic 5":0.0175892422396233,"Topic 6":0.0336615771098658,"Topic 7":0.0568629628700056,"Topic 8":0.00360066259853875,"Topic 9":0.14665039737148,"Topic 10":0.00417677582167052,"Topic 11":0.0219977912955178,"Topic 12":0.164958512605915,"Topic 13":0.020008966964378,"Topic 14":0.0122610033840556,"Topic 15":0.0602574351065023},{"id":353,"body":"L'Amore D'Italia is a nice family run Italian restaurant.

The area is replete with 99\u00a2 pizza joints and littered with hot-dog stops. Respectable feeding is hard to come by.\n\nBut they're around and slowly I'll tread the waters. The other day I tried the Garage Caf\u00e9, a Pizza slash burger slash pasta restaurant. Reassuringly the place was packed and people were standing outside drinking. The place looks like the neighborhood food stop filled with regulars that simply walked to get there. \n\nThe d\u00e9cor is a bit patchy but has flair of its own, service is friendly but a bit slow but they try with all the traffic. The menu is varied but offers nothing innovating yet isn't boring either. Fun comfort food to have with beer, wine or sangria.\n \nAs is often the case, I'm in no mood for alcohol after work (Unless I'm not working the next day) so I ordered a Coca-cola and this was the interesting part, they serve it in a Mason jar that has a handle on it. Loved the idea so much I want some of my own now.\n\nNot feeling the pasta menu because it's my fall-back plan when I don't know what to prepare for myself at home I hit the Burger Menu, something I never get bored of. I love a good burger so much I'd eat one for breakfast and I have in the past thanks to American Diners. So I went for the Four By Four. \n\nThe Four by Four is a healthy helping of Beef (of course) and Philly Cream Cheese, Bacon and fried Mushrooms and Onions. All ingredients I simply can't get enough. Sadly I didn't get enough. The patty was a whopper but seriously if you're gonna be a restaurant called the GARAGE CAF\u00c9, to me it seems like a grease monkey wouldn't eat a flimsy burger and with the price, gimme something to chew on.\n\nBurger 101: A burger must be meaty, juicy, greasy and yes a sloppy mess. But also it's gotta be heavy on the toppings and I'm not talking ketchup. \n\nIf you tell me you're gonna put some Philly Cream cheese, don't scrape it on; slather it on thick. The mushrooms? I want them flowing from the sides. And the bacon... the bacon. How many times have I said this? Life has no meaning without bacon. This was the big epic FAIL of this Burger that coulda-been. When I go to my local La Belle Province - often derided for being the bottom of the barrel of fast food restaurants in Montreal - and order a bacon-cheese burger, the cook takes out 3 or 4 slices of fresh uncooked bacon and drops them on the grill before taking out the fresh burger patties and then making me a super fresh and tasty messy sloppy burger. But at Garage Caf\u00e9, I got one tiny slice of pre-cooked bacon. Come On! And the patty was to perfectly round and well shaped to be fresh prepared.\n\nThe fries were pretty damn tasty though and it was served with a side of very tangy and spicy mayonnaise that added some serious punch to the burger. The burger wasn't bad in the final analysis it just could have easily been an out of this world kick-ass burger with a few simple steps.\n\n3 buns outta 5","delta.star":-0.5,"review.effect":"Negative","average.stars":"3.5","review.stars":"3","sentiment":0.108473535459934,"Topic 1":0.0535472481706809,"Topic 2":0.128159700248737,"Topic 3":0.0457400419518298,"Topic 4":0.00162505538361251,"Topic 5":0.0222926295181844,"Topic 6":0.0532427048593098,"Topic 7":0.0421422071047759,"Topic 8":0.0566504074603342,"Topic 9":0.00399911736195109,"Topic 10":0.00804356294435492,"Topic 11":0.0303110191597168,"Topic 12":0.0198434951601246,"Topic 13":0.390195821869096,"Topic 14":0.0198145096471665,"Topic 15":0.124392479160126},{"id":361,"body":"Grade: C\n\nDecent.

I received a email to come and try the $7.99 All U Can Eat Taco special that is available all-day. The wait time to be seated is about 20 min but that is expected because the restaurant is brand new to the Aliante community. Sitting at the bar is quicker and the bartender is pretty cool. \n\nBut this entire experience turned into something very horrible. Once we were seated and placed our order for two tacos each, it took Cabo exactly one hour to bring the first order of tacos out to us. Prior to receiving our food, we had to complain to the manager that its taking forever and he advised us that our food is now ready to be delivered to our table. Moments later one of our many waitress' advised us that our order has been lost and they have to start over on making our food. This really had me beyond upset. Once again we complained to the manager and he offered to comp our drinks from the bar and food.\n\nNow, once our food finally came out after many complaints and waitinf for 60 minutes to get it and eating through two baskets of chips, we all thought everything was going to be smooth sailing from there until the one person in my party, who's allergic to tomatoes and onions, began to feel really really sick while eating. She distinctly told the manager and a waiter and waitress that she's allergic to those ingredients three times before ordering. They didn't put the ingredients on her tacos but failed to tell her that they marinated their meats in a tomatoe and onion sauce.\n\nAfter she ran out the restaurant to puke all of her food up the manager kept asking me if I would like another drink and I'm like \"No! You jerk! You guys just poisoned my friend!\". Cabo eventually called security who then called the EMT's who had to treat her. It was so embarrassing. After being treated and filing an incident report with Aliante Casino's Risk Management department we went back to Cabo to get a business card and info of the manager. His name was Joe, he refused to give us his last name, and gave us a business card of Cabo's food and beverage director who's not even located in Las Vegas. How unprofessional is that?!\n\nOn the other hand, Pricing on food ranges from $4-$18 depending on what you order. They also have a 3p-6:30p on Fridays and that includes $4-$6 and a drink special that include beverages from $4-$6.\n\nOverall, the new addition to Aliante casino is horrid! I will never again in my life order food or even a glass of water from this horrible restaurant. We even told the manager that we're affiliates of Yelp.com and he gave us a serious blank stare and asked \"What is Yelp?\". Really sir?! Smh at this unorganized establishment and its rude staff. The only reason I give this restaurant one Yelp Star rating is because its not available to give them a negative five Yelp Star.","delta.star":-0.5,"review.effect":"Negative","average.stars":"1.5","review.stars":"1","sentiment":-0.260346195032759,"Topic 1":0.010091007733595,"Topic 2":0.065435569108775,"Topic 3":0.0686223153041125,"Topic 4":0.00233043224113279,"Topic 5":0.00602161789838228,"Topic 6":0.246547687436745,"Topic 7":0.0143233608515979,"Topic 8":0.00686370459915123,"Topic 9":0.0060328270521245,"Topic 10":0.0599206589950559,"Topic 11":0.468124712726505,"Topic 12":0.00721945890900584,"Topic 13":0.0153059707163282,"Topic 14":0.0136559182808035,"Topic 15":0.00950475814668529},{"id":369,"body":"I received a coupon to come in and try them because they were open.

I hate to give a negative review as a first review and also hate to give a negative review to a place that allowed me to come to their grand opening, but it just wasn't very good. The food they were serving definitely should have been good, for example, they had a kobe beef slider....sounds good, right? No....it was not good. It was ground kobe, not sure why you would grind such expensive meat, and it was covered in a weird sauce and then topped with velveeta. Yes....velveeta. It was such a waste of a good meat, you couldn't taste the meat at all...it could have been ground anything for all you could tell. Additionally, the BF found a bone in his....not so appetizing. They also had mini burger bites, that were decent, but the way they were served made it so you couldn't taste any of the toppings because they all fell off before it got to your mouth (they were little balls with bacon and whatnot on top skewered with a toothpick, so the bacon and things fell off when the burger was picked up). The crab mac and cheese was mediocre and I believe had velveeta in it as well....how weird. The pork sweet and spicy wings were an odd texture and tasted like frozen food. Not good. The only thing that was decent was the spicy mango cone....a mango pudding of sorts with cayenne in it served in an ice cream cone. We ended up leaving after only a short period of time because we didn't want to continue tasting/wasting their food....that's pretty bad when the food is free. Maybe this place just needs to work out some kinks, but it was surprising that they hadn't done so before this event.","delta.star":-1,"review.effect":"Negative","average.stars":"3","review.stars":"2","sentiment":-0.0889289678573275,"Topic 1":0.0684206478242416,"Topic 2":0.079621011361151,"Topic 3":0.0144451782783965,"Topic 4":0.0249350860298769,"Topic 5":0.0169133496381043,"Topic 6":0.268930226479623,"Topic 7":0.0221014693906038,"Topic 8":0.0148428343013078,"Topic 9":0.0231631700591061,"Topic 10":0.00532609249447575,"Topic 11":0.0406532657256659,"Topic 12":0.290984360041733,"Topic 13":0.0993193136576969,"Topic 14":0.0138081008515195,"Topic 15":0.0165358938664989},{"id":379,"body":"We were in the mood for pizza and a drink last Friday, and my friend and I stumbled upon Carmella's in Carmel Commons.

I would recommend to try the salad or the burrito although you won't be disappointed with anything you order here","delta.star":2,"review.effect":"Positive","average.stars":"3","review.stars":"5","sentiment":0.444713810159735,"Topic 1":0.0346275073500748,"Topic 2":0.101242185641153,"Topic 3":0.0284248163218912,"Topic 4":0.0129672191148154,"Topic 5":0.0217836026657525,"Topic 6":0.0188162303505382,"Topic 7":0.339480533005787,"Topic 8":0.00780665054808236,"Topic 9":0.0213859633168485,"Topic 10":0.278674562471232,"Topic 11":0.0305258302872572,"Topic 12":0.0384764179482396,"Topic 13":0.0161193310460763,"Topic 14":0.0243016096093841,"Topic 15":0.0253675403228685},{"id":392,"body":"This new spot is located right between two existing kick-butt restaurants -- Delux and Zen 32. And it is owned by the same group. Revo B is sure to be a hit with the trendy Biltmore crowd looking for a relaxed place to have healthy organic mexi. It will remind you very much of Blue Burrito. We ate there tonight in a soft open/evaluate the restaurant opening. Revo specializes in organic fresh ingredients including Harris ranch meats and top shelf fish--see the website. If this new kid on the block is anything like its bordering siblings, we will have a big winner. I ordered the carne asada burrito but got the Chicken Fajita burrito. The floor manager apologized and promised to make the kitchen aware of the mistake, but did not offer to replace. This burrito was free and really good so I didn't care. The rice side dish is very tasty with corn and lots of butter --shades of latin risotto. My wife had the same meal but in a bowl and she loved it. We also had their flavored lemonade --raspberry and mango and they were both done well. There is a choice of three different salsa/hot sauce toppings, but we couldn't hear the girl behind the counter (am I 100?) and so, just nodded our heads. I got something green and hot and really good. RB- consider posting these salsa options somewhere on the menu. Being the soft open, there were mistakes being made with orders around us, but nobody seemed to mind too much. RB is the kind of place where whatever you get, you will like. They have some kind of donutty-looking deserts displayed but won't be ready to serve until the full opening. Dining area looks cramped, but the stools help make it a lot more open than it first appears. There is decent sidewalk seating which will be popular when the weather is cool. There is also a walk-up take out window. Looking forward to coming back and also reading other reviews.","delta.star":0.5,"review.effect":"Positive","average.stars":"3.5","review.stars":"4","sentiment":0.497625735850645,"Topic 1":0.0622691938564837,"Topic 2":0.0916042115677863,"Topic 3":0.1457017898454,"Topic 4":0.0112928635235158,"Topic 5":0.0497217081415975,"Topic 6":0.0201630093145131,"Topic 7":0.0720667390821188,"Topic 8":0.00317321922093562,"Topic 9":0.0112043698305217,"Topic 10":0.213660540131916,"Topic 11":0.191064122073431,"Topic 12":0.0384485745404755,"Topic 13":0.0247296113795537,"Topic 14":0.0339761813022152,"Topic 15":0.0309238661895365},{"id":393,"body":"Good lunch deals: $9-$13 for main course with coffee, dessert and soup.\nBut food was less than average.\nDespite that the place was packed with locals.","delta.star":-1,"review.effect":"Negative","average.stars":"3","review.stars":"2","sentiment":0.0996679946249557,"Topic 1":0.0652620091606405,"Topic 2":0.16847864626673,"Topic 3":0.0685381014540432,"Topic 4":0.0207087359708655,"Topic 5":0.154688515837375,"Topic 6":0.151024380930764,"Topic 7":0.0989322063718607,"Topic 8":0.0175810768535442,"Topic 9":0.0316633985785917,"Topic 10":0.00705047657687106,"Topic 11":0.0751011002075041,"Topic 12":0.0352300300172313,"Topic 13":0.0147991794350953,"Topic 14":0.0554400481386733,"Topic 15":0.0355020942002103},{"id":394,"body":"I went to Smashburger today.

I ordered the AZ Smashburger.  It comes with habanero chile cheese, chipotle mayo, and jalapenos along with all the standard fixings.  I ordered the Smash fries.  They are drenched in olive oil and are seasoned with rosemary.  To drink, I had a Cherry Coke.  That was a nice surprise at the soda fountain.  My burger was good, not great.  You can choose from a third or half pound burger.  I went with the third.  My fries were wet.  They tasted okay.  I compare rosemary fries with Fez's rosemary fries.  Smashburger's are lacking.  The oil is a bit much and for some reason they were not salty enough.  They were bland wet fries.  I will go back to Smashburger.  I will choose it over Mac Donald's or Burger King.

(It's offered to parties of two or more doing AYCE only.)\n\nAdult prices: $19.95\nKid prices: 8 years old and younger: $12.95\n\nA little banchan starts your Korean meal - Korean pancake, broccoli, pickled cucumbers, and potato. Not much here.\n\nAs the waitress was getting our table set up, I asked her if I'm supposed to go ahead and tell her what I want.  She mentioned something about them usually bringing everything out, unless I have a preference.  We definitely did have a preference because we didn't quite want it all!\n\nThere are about seven different appetizers to choose from, we went with:\n\n* Garlic Edamame \"Soy bean with spicy garlic sauce)\n* Gyoza (Deep fried dumpling)\n* Chicken Wing (Spicy marinated)\n\nThe kitchen list has about six items, and we got:\n\n* Tonkatsu (Deep fried breaded pork)\n* Vegetable Tempura (Assorted vegetable deep fried)\n* Kake Udon (Thick noodles soup with fried tofu, fish cake, seaweed)\n* Fried Rice (Vegetable)\n\nFrom the Korean BBQ list of four items:\n\n* Galbi (Angus marinated BBQ beef ribs)\n* Samgyubsal (Pork belly)\n(Our waitress did all the cooking for us here, so that was nice.)\n\nFrom the Classic Rolls list of seven items:\n\n* Salmon Skin Roll (grilled salmon skin)\n* Spicy Tuna Roll (spicy tuna, cucumber)\n\nFor dessert, you get only one scoop of vanilla or green tea ice cream.\n\nThe staff really didn't want our fellow diners to not do AYCE with us, but we told them otherwise.  The MIL and her companion chose to order off their regular Japanese menu.  They both had the Combination Dinner Special which includes salad, rice, miso soup, gyoza, and two items from their list for $13.50.  (It's $15.50 if you want three items.)  She went for the tonkatsu and miso saba, while he went for the shrimp tempura and calamari tempura.  However, we think he got the short end of the stick because there were only two pieces of shrimp and the rest were veggies.  (In retrospect, he would have done the Shrimp Tempura Entree dinner for $12.90 and gotten 6 pieces of shrimp instead.)  What a bummer!  They also got what looked like a half order of a CA roll with their meal.\n\nService was good for the latter part.  Our initial waitress was a bit spacey, until we moved into the bbq section and then that waitress was better and a lot more friendlier.  \n\nIt was only a Tuesday night, but they had a steady stream of customers - some sitting at the tables, another sitting at the AYCE bbq section, and more sitting at the sushi bar.  They have a pretty extensive menu, and the sushi menu is pretty long.\n\nOverall, it wasn't bad for AYCE.  Sure, we've had a better selection for a fraction of the price, but it'll have to do for the southwest area for now.  But for more bang for your buck, you're better off over on Spring Mountain.","delta.star":0,"review.effect":"Neutral","average.stars":"3","review.stars":"3","sentiment":0.0546369461332388,"Topic 1":0.0093358167181602,"Topic 2":0.0670571415046316,"Topic 3":0.0378539375223577,"Topic 4":0.422476319497377,"Topic 5":0.0691886837138968,"Topic 6":0.040874797839193,"Topic 7":0.0218470816192601,"Topic 8":0.00558249359982418,"Topic 9":0.049216012653206,"Topic 10":0.00167614237824585,"Topic 11":0.114485402235401,"Topic 12":0.10532061034058,"Topic 13":0.0307585476327829,"Topic 14":0.00722828737370822,"Topic 15":0.0170987253713756},{"id":400,"body":"Cheeseburgers, easy to eat and carry on a plane.","delta.star":2.5,"review.effect":"Positive","average.stars":"2.5","review.stars":"5","sentiment":0.165140412924629,"Topic 1":0.0324981686632785,"Topic 2":0.21276907243358,"Topic 3":0.0503157148598132,"Topic 4":0.00726777690018149,"Topic 5":0.0176153695010363,"Topic 6":0.0599024030023931,"Topic 7":0.12990926467481,"Topic 8":0.0441014298283934,"Topic 9":0.0244237937744607,"Topic 10":0.0161306112905844,"Topic 11":0.0842122161849975,"Topic 12":0.0300978161751653,"Topic 13":0.179883252501006,"Topic 14":0.0467799697218926,"Topic 15":0.0640931404884083},{"id":401,"body":"Nice wee cafe this.

This will definitely be a do-over for us so we can try more of the menu.","delta.star":0,"review.effect":"Neutral","average.stars":"4","review.stars":"4","sentiment":0.384288356643736,"Topic 1":0.0990472382775366,"Topic 2":0.0656257316005501,"Topic 3":0.0921961573925763,"Topic 4":0.01817200720698,"Topic 5":0.169986216710206,"Topic 6":0.0213148703791745,"Topic 7":0.293644889745413,"Topic 8":0.0196421434981032,"Topic 9":0.0116919955149092,"Topic 10":0.00796935512498208,"Topic 11":0.0814188277082751,"Topic 12":0.0428365451021683,"Topic 13":0.0111033152404024,"Topic 14":0.0239769760926961,"Topic 15":0.0413737304060263},{"id":404,"body":"Have invaded yesterday evening after the game day with 10 hungry athletes at the El Greco.\nService was friendly, the portions good, it tasted, the food stand in a reasonable time on the table and first and foremost, there was a Begr\u00fc\u00dfungsouzo.\nWe were happy and that's worth 4 stars.","delta.star":1,"review.effect":"Positive","average.stars":"3","review.stars":"4","sentiment":0.407835989441286,"Topic 1":0.0220495958164255,"Topic 2":0.160394399717866,"Topic 3":0.104588300000461,"Topic 4":0.0160376248728651,"Topic 5":0.0379935439652874,"Topic 6":0.0427001378393768,"Topic 7":0.382629266283512,"Topic 8":0.0183068484480576,"Topic 9":0.0223357370170701,"Topic 10":0.0149745431917776,"Topic 11":0.101348363087105,"Topic 12":0.0177689114742915,"Topic 13":0.014725204201577,"Topic 14":0.0201488597724095,"Topic 15":0.023998664311918},{"id":405,"body":"I have a confession to make my fellow yelpers...\n\nI am SO sorry to say this, but I've been hiding a lil gem all to myself. China Buffet is my all-time favorite chinese food buffet. We're always greeted with a smile and a nice autmosphere, I like the sing-songy contempo chinese pop in the background, it's not too loud so it's good. \n\nThe dining area is vast and is always kept clean. The uniformed staff are always on the ball - clearing plates as soon as you take your last bite and always offer to refil drinks.\n\nThe food is very very good. I love the bbq pork. The sesame chicken & beef n broccoli are favorites of mine as well. Their wonton soup is super yummy! I always start every meal a nice bowl of a couple of 'tons. lol. \n\nBut the real attraction for me is the Sushi Bar!! Their sushi is real hit or miss... but is more hit than miss... and since it comes with the meal - it's worth atleast taking a gander at. Their salmon nigiri is always good when in stock, as is their shrimp nigir - but I have had a couple of pieces of bad tuna nigiri, which disappoints me but I still go back and give it a go. When tipped well - the sushi chef will make things to order. The sushi isn't the best in the city - by far, but it is good. \n\nI've taken a lot of people to China Buffet and everyone liked it except for one friend who thought their abolone was gross... but abolone IS gross... regardless of where it comes from. \n\nAnd so i say unto you, my fellow yelpers please forgive me for keeping this place a secret. I hope you try China Buffet and enjoy your visit. It's one of my favorite places to dine anywhere and I constantly use this place a measuring rod for the new chinese places I visit and they rarely compare.","delta.star":1,"review.effect":"Positive","average.stars":"4","review.stars":"5","sentiment":0.375792632838934,"Topic 1":0.00612039368782919,"Topic 2":0.109214583800896,"Topic 3":0.029809300197772,"Topic 4":0.131161363534516,"Topic 5":0.0211810294319308,"Topic 6":0.0498954018591399,"Topic 7":0.198212102786012,"Topic 8":0.00488000391038048,"Topic 9":0.180016414212356,"Topic 10":0.00551133737487157,"Topic 11":0.0873169052934835,"Topic 12":0.0130652178991434,"Topic 13":0.00504133317503238,"Topic 14":0.00487968269352583,"Topic 15":0.153694930143111},{"id":406,"body":"I have had both a salad and a froyo from here on two separate occasions and just want to warn folks - check your bill and your meal.

Walking and driving past it, we've been watching the restaurant being built with lots of anticipation and excitement of what was going to arrive.  So I was really excited to walk by this past Thursday to see it open for business.  I went in just to grab a menu, and instead met the bartender and manager, and enjoyed a great Four Peaks Coronado Ale and got to find out what the place is all about.  The decor of the restaurant is beautiful: There is great art work covering the walls from a Tucson artist that is all for sale, and the mismatched chairs with the quaint reading room off to the side, combined with the wood detail throughout the bar was beautiful.  The bathrooms were even amazingly decorated with the greatest sinks!  Anyways, I went back tonight to finally have a full meal to find a completely packed house.  For only being open a week, I couldn't get over the fact that it seemed like everyone from the neighborhood was there and then some, it was so great to see. But, back to the food- I finally got to try my prosciutto and mac and cheese, and it was amazing!  Followed up with a dirty martini, it was definitely a great meal and experience.

The person taking our order left the register a few times while we decided on what to order, and we ended up having to wait for a few minutes... then it must have taken about 10 minutes to get our order, and my iced coffee was never prepared, I had to go ask for it, and it was not low ice as I had asked. \n\nSo, as I said, the whole concept of fast food is just 'food' some times.\n\nThe only place that comes to mind that has always been prompt, good, nice and friendly is the McDonald's at Glendale Rd, just West of Highway 51.","delta.star":0,"review.effect":"Neutral","average.stars":"3","review.stars":"3","sentiment":0.209006304937827,"Topic 1":0.156611794786977,"Topic 2":0.198898691946541,"Topic 3":0.0265746959280174,"Topic 4":0.00641368287265861,"Topic 5":0.00992337429146175,"Topic 6":0.0494756479957791,"Topic 7":0.0946487340881352,"Topic 8":0.00659641570041359,"Topic 9":0.0209428051849803,"Topic 10":0.00763094136103089,"Topic 11":0.359462403238526,"Topic 12":0.0102512764434081,"Topic 13":0.0161081350563687,"Topic 14":0.0160777813469385,"Topic 15":0.0203836197587642},{"id":417,"body":"Top coffee, top location.\nVery small and private.","delta.star":-1.5,"review.effect":"Negative","average.stars":"4.5","review.stars":"3","sentiment":0.458155892572579,"Topic 1":0.181865630508706,"Topic 2":0.122459220051484,"Topic 3":0.0690877022601594,"Topic 4":0.00923320323263496,"Topic 5":0.106047640442779,"Topic 6":0.0353434663318128,"Topic 7":0.146460792930475,"Topic 8":0.0486208440829141,"Topic 9":0.0102661204147784,"Topic 10":0.0058774634305208,"Topic 11":0.0697515260690761,"Topic 12":0.0758338416541475,"Topic 13":0.0203170423384031,"Topic 14":0.0591596698203066,"Topic 15":0.0396758364318022},{"id":418,"body":"I was in a bind last night before the 7pm movie and wanted to eat something substantial for dinner instead of popcorn or candy at the theater...

The food here is so delightfully delicious, it deserved that moment of silence.\n\nHoused within The Fruitmarket Gallery, the Cafe is worth a visit (or five) in its own right. In a slightly unassuming spot beside the Dungeons, and tacked onto the back of Waverly Station, it almost feels like it's *too* central to be this good. Normally little gems are hard to hide, they're hidden, they are worth the extra walk outside the city centre. Right?\n\nWell The Fruitmarket Gallery Cafe has it down. It's super central, it's a beautiful light, open space with plenty room, and the food is superb.\n\nThere's quite a large selection, and it's all quite 'different' to your usual fare. Salads, soups and sandwiches but also daily specials of which I've tried the cous cous stuffed peppers, the vegetarian tagine, and chickpea number. As you can see, they provide a lot of vegetarian options.\n\nThe seafood platter is also delicious. Smoked salmon, king prawns, mackerel pate. And whilst \u00a37.50 isn't cheap for a normal lunch, you could easily share this, as the amount of food you get is quite spectacular.\n\nLet me take another moment for the cakes, or more specifically, the rhubarb tart. It is apparently famed in Edinburgh for being the best rhubarb tart you can get. They display all their cakes up on the counter, all of which are drool-worthy. I was intrigued by the little pork-pie looking numbers, was told they were rhubarb tarts, and thought why not?! Oh my good golly, I'm so glad I did. Absolutely delicious, especially with the cream and spiced ginger on the side.\n\nAlthough coffee drinkers, take note. The coffee comes in one size, and is quite small. Sad face.\n\nThis is a fantastic space, is great for business lunches, a pit-stop for tea and cake, or somewhere to while away an afternoon solo with a book / laptop and a decadent lunch for one. It's one of my new favourite lunchtime spots in the city. \n\nRhubarbrhubarbrhubarb....","delta.star":1,"review.effect":"Positive","average.stars":"4","review.stars":"5","sentiment":0.408012367884044,"Topic 1":0.390801131780864,"Topic 2":0.0637471308671034,"Topic 3":0.0175354939573415,"Topic 4":0.0630549999775377,"Topic 5":0.0757720728093181,"Topic 6":0.0166843886634131,"Topic 7":0.114529107431399,"Topic 8":0.00341692487019206,"Topic 9":0.0108928161424793,"Topic 10":0.00266993794704321,"Topic 11":0.0515649667891811,"Topic 12":0.0278694089804766,"Topic 13":0.00905387627484585,"Topic 14":0.0698260605045959,"Topic 15":0.0825816830042084},{"id":421,"body":"The Forth Floor Restaurant is located on the top floor of Harvey Nichols and as you would expect it is one of the best restaurants in Edinburgh, attentive but not obtrusive staff, wonderfull views with a skyline of rooftops extending to the Castle in the south and the Forth in the North, while the restaurant is light and airy.

The chef is a truly master chef! Every dish that came out was a piece of art! He greatly dedicated his time and his master sushi chef skills in making our food looks to pretty and artsy. We were blown away by his creativity and his fast cooking skills.\n\nConclusion:\nAt the end I would definitely recommend all my friends and family to try out this new all you can eat sushi restaurant. It is a great bang for the buck$$!\n\nAll you can deal\n\n$25-29.99 (forgot the price) but it is for sure under $30\nadd $10 more for all you can drink (sake, beers)","delta.star":1,"review.effect":"Positive","average.stars":"4","review.stars":"5","sentiment":0.612179024357931,"Topic 1":0.00947688700718246,"Topic 2":0.216081383371787,"Topic 3":0.0429577140929555,"Topic 4":0.116816919143424,"Topic 5":0.187400928520344,"Topic 6":0.0160024932067189,"Topic 7":0.289440748462515,"Topic 8":0.00527343778205498,"Topic 9":0.0117484506381019,"Topic 10":0.00399532071077168,"Topic 11":0.05336990439915,"Topic 12":0.0107476361888482,"Topic 13":0.00398574434279587,"Topic 14":0.00738987536997522,"Topic 15":0.0253125567633751},{"id":446,"body":"I love Port of Subs!

I noticed that there were many vegetarian options and 20 lunch specials.  \n\nI finally decided on the 'kang-ped' veggie with tofu, which is eggplant and veggies cooked in a red curry, coconut milk.  It was served with my choice of soup or salad (i went with salad), steamed white  rice, and an eggroll.  My friend had the pad thai which he said was really good.

A dimsum restaurant in Montreal that's worth talking about? Get out of here! But we finally have an alternative for dimsum other than Kam Fung or Ruby Rouge; an alternative with a slight modern twist (read fancier and more expensive.\n\nAs we entered the restaurant, I was in awe! The setting is surprisingly beautiful: modern look, chair covers, fancy plates and huge windows (the fireworks will be partially visible in the summertime I believe). I am sure this restaurant will be a very popular spot for upcoming weddings.\n\nUnlike the other places, there are no old Chinese women who barely speak English pushing carts between tables. Instead, younger waitresses take down your order and bring them to you as they come right off the kitchen.\n\nThe food was in general very good. Some of the dishes had a modern twist to it. For example, they had a rice noodle roll stuffed with Kobe beef. Another dumpling had a touch of truffle oil.\n\nHowever, the service was seriously lacking. I'd even say it was horrendous! Spilled water (on my friend), spilled sauce (on my other friend's jacket), a batch of dumpling still raw, etc. The waitress just showed my friend the way to the bathroom to clean his jacket. The worst is that they took so long to bring some of our food that we gave up and asked for the bill even though there was still 1/4 of our order still to go. I think all of us left still a bit hungry but we didn't care at this point. We complained to management only to receive some meager apologies. \n\nFor any other restaurant, I'd suggest NOT to go based on the horrible service. However, I really want this restaurant to succeed. Yes it's a bit more expensive but I don't really mind: you pay for the fancier setting! The food is good enough that I'll go back for sure. I believe that le Cristal Chinois is a good addition to the Chinatown scene: a breath of fresh air! \n\nPS: Please note that we went there on New Year's Day. Not only was it a very busy day but they had been opened for only 2 weeks.

It is situated at the canal basin that marks the end of the Union Canal, which links Edinburgh to Falkirk.

We arrived for a late dinner and were received by the hostess, who was thoroughly un-friendly, especially by Four Seasons standards.  Then it took over 5 minutes for our server to come over and tell us she'd be back soon to take our order.  We were a little worried that the service would be totally abysmal, but we ended up with a different server after that, but she was terrific.  We ordered the 3-course meal for $39 per person, and she nicely agreed to substitute the chocolate dessert, as chocolate keeps me up late at night.  Our first course was a salmon pastrami, and I think we were both curious to see what that meant, but it was just like it sounds - smoked salmon, peppered around the edges, and they curled it, stood it up, filled it with fresh crab meat, and drizzled citrus vinaigrette on the plate, with a side of haricots vert.  The main course was a lamb chop, with a side of a grain similar to cous-cous, although they called it something else.  The lamb was juicy and the sauce complemented it very well.  Finally, for dessert, we had the creme brulee with fresh berries and the apple pie.  Both were delicious, but my only complaint would be that the creme brulee was a little too sweet, and the dough on the pie a little too salty.  All-in-all, it was a very nice meal, in a beautiful setting.  The dining room is elegant, with a Southwestern flair, a long outdoor fire, and views overlooking the mountains and the whole city below.  It might not be one of the most progressive or acclaimed culinary destinations in the Valley, but this special pricing is a good deal for what you get, and the food is great.","delta.star":0,"review.effect":"Neutral","average.stars":"4","review.stars":"4","sentiment":0.377295134557229,"Topic 1":0.0141349999562145,"Topic 2":0.0400046651804624,"Topic 3":0.0455139940861801,"Topic 4":0.00736468575892286,"Topic 5":0.416140033930508,"Topic 6":0.0192233459280835,"Topic 7":0.0715594230225319,"Topic 8":0.0497481549330987,"Topic 9":0.00642779726875978,"Topic 10":0.00233732819974147,"Topic 11":0.12563639269287,"Topic 12":0.146441324801543,"Topic 13":0.00734917725931597,"Topic 14":0.0280839729610543,"Topic 15":0.0200347040207125},{"id":479,"body":"Okay....my review for this one is the same as the other one on Bell...they are pretty much identical except there is more parking at this location....and occassionally you get a distracted server....but for the most part the service is good.\n\nI only ding it a star for the singing.

It's where Huahachinango use to be. I live nearby and got a flyer promoting their restaurant and decided to try it out today. I went with a friend of mine for lunch and the place was empty. Now I'm chalking that up to the fact that we went for a late lunch; it was around 1 or so. \n\nI had a carne asada plate. The carne asade come on top of a macaroni salad and fries. The meat itself is topped with mustard, onions and a meat sauce, which I opted to have on the side. I'm glad I did, as I found the sauce a bit bland. I wanted a kick or something, but I didn't get it without adding any of their toppings or anything. The macaroni salad was all right. Rather than using an elbow pasta, they used conchiglie and the mayo wasn't that sweet mayo I abhor. The fries weren't bad either. They weren't the usual shoestring cut and they weren't overly salty or oily. The carne asada itself was all right. It got a little too salty for me at one point. It was moist enough without the sauce. I was expecting more since the pictures on the wall make it seem like they'd have more to their dishes. My friend had a devil blanco plate and had the grilled chicken. It came with the same thing mine came with. She unfortunately got everything on it and it kinda dampened the enjoyment of the dish. I'm willing to give this place another try to see if something else there will be better. \n\nA bit about the place: it says on the window that they're open on Friday and Saturday till 3am, but I'm not sure about that since as I've said, I live nearby and I haven't noticed them open. They're having a special, or at least did today when I went in - the plates were like 5.95 and it came with a drink. And according to the flyer we get, they're offering a two for one thing - buy a plate and you get one free. I don't know if that's still going on, but that's what the flyer we got said.\n\n***Edit to add a tip: add hot sauce to the food cause it makes the difference. A huge difference. It doesn't really change my rating, except to maybe a 2 1/2 stars.

I have been watching the countdown for the new store on Craig to open for months now.  I was so happy today when I saw on Facebook you were finally open.  My heart was all aflutter and I couldn't get over there fast enough to grab a ridiculously messy and oh so good chili cheese burger and fries.  And then it went downhill...\n\nFirst, the location itself is tucked into a corner of a big shopping center.  There are only 3 parking spots near the restaurant.  Otherwise you have to park and walk across the entrance to the drive thru side which had a lot of cross traffic.  People were driving all sorts of crazy in this area, so be careful walking around here since there really isn't a clear path to walk on.\n\nI actually had to do drive thru today because my kiddo had fallen asleep on the way over.  It is easy to get into the drive thru, but really tricky once you have picked up your food.  The driveway is very narrow and quite close to the building.  I drive a mid-size sedan and it was tight.  I feel bad for anyone is a big SUV or full size truck.  Pay attention or you might hit the wall.\n\nNext, the order taker.  She was really quite friendly, but was on the pushy side.  I needed a second to review the board to know what to order for my daughter to eat later.  I asked to have a minute to check the board.  I think I got maybe 15 seconds before she was asking if I was ready to order yet.  There wasn't a line, so I am not sure why she was in such a rush.  \n\nI went ahead and ordered and then she asked if I wanted to upsize my drink for an extra $.50.  I said very clearly, \"No thanks\" to which she said \"Ok.\"  I assumed that meant I would getting a regular sized drink, silly me!  I get up to the window and she hands me a large soda, which I was totally charged for, so it wasn't just a mistake by whoever was serving up the sodas.  I told her I said a regular and she said she thought I said to upsize it.  I wasn't in the mood to argue, so I just took the drink.  I mean I love soda and can easy drink 2 liters in no time, but I am trying to be good and cut back on my soda addiction.  So much for that!  It was just fishy, in my opinion.  I don't know if the girl really made a mistake or wanted to improve her up-sell totals.  So watch out for that trap.\n\nNext was my burger order.  I ordered a regular chili cheese burger.  I specifically asked to have no onions because they are yucky.  The girl told me that they only put onions on burgers if you request them.  I said great and to please keep them off of my burger.  So you can imagine my surprise when I got home, having been drooling over the burger next to me for the last 3 miles, and then took a big bite into my burger that was covered with ONIONS.  Ugh.  I have never seen so many onions, it was almost like i got an extra helping of them.  Fun times for sure.\n\nSo after I took a bite into my onion infested burger, I had to take a big swig of my giant soda to wash the onions down.  Guess what?  The soda mix was totally off.  I mean the place had been open for 2.5 hours by the time I was there.  How was the soda to syrup mix already goofed up?  So yes, I paid extra for gross soda.  \n\nOn the positive side, the burger was super tasty (once I picked all of the onions off) and smothered in delicious Tommy's chili and cheese.  The fries were simply amazing! I have no shame, so I scrapped all of the extra chili cheese off of the paper they were wrapped in. Yummmm, cheese paper.... If you haven't tried a Tommy burger, you really need too!\n\nI still love Tommy's, even after all of the messes listed above.  I am giving this location the benefit of the doubt and giving them 3 stars.  It is their opening day, so maybe everyone is working out the kinks.","delta.star":0,"review.effect":"Neutral","average.stars":"3","review.stars":"3","sentiment":-0.0289538495822106,"Topic 1":0.00709440582020815,"Topic 2":0.209120770753098,"Topic 3":0.0469422948567429,"Topic 4":0.00124263393436009,"Topic 5":0.00241344367224978,"Topic 6":0.0676772741777657,"Topic 7":0.0187623067811448,"Topic 8":0.00362854446703787,"Topic 9":0.00288907890735604,"Topic 10":0.00376885935510062,"Topic 11":0.313291600177732,"Topic 12":0.00507194555248981,"Topic 13":0.293524948365338,"Topic 14":0.00918251866202908,"Topic 15":0.0153893745173469},{"id":498,"body":"Peking Garden is a wonderful place, excellent for its variety of interesting dishes and pleasant atmosphere.

I would have no idea it said this but it's what my mom saw when we were originally set to go to BBQ King across the parking lot.\n\nWe should have gone to BBQ King.\n\nWe started with a cold seaweed appetizer which was mixed with cilantro. This dishes flavor had a  nice pop to it because of the cilantro but the texture was mushy and overall- mediocre.\n\nThe appetizer  of cold chicken with hot and spicy sauce was okay. It really just looked like steamed chicken marinated in siracha sauce. It was rather disappointing really... but what can you expect when the exact translation of the dish is \"saliva chicken.\" (gross)\n\nThe spicy lamb soup noodles came out in a giant bowl with almost a curry red and yellow color to the broth. It looked really promising. But then, when you got  a whiff of the soup, WOOOOO WHEEEEE! That's some game-y ass lamb! My mom and I each took two bites, and pushed it aside.\n\nHer bowl of red braised beef noodles had very little braised beef and the giant bowl was really deceiving once you dipped into it for the noodles. I could have eaten a full 2 bowls of these portions in order to be full.\n\nThe restaurant is actually a step up in decor from most chinese fast food places. But... the waitstaff needs some serious training. Sure they smiled. Sure they took our order, but that was it. No checking back. And certainly no understanding of customer service when the food itself sucked. We sent back the lamb noodles and the waitstaff was totally puzzled. Like... this has never ever happened and they don't know WHY anyone would ever send food back. Even worse, the waitstaff didn't speak any english so outside of sticking my tongue out, squinting my eyes and pointing at the bowl of soup, they had no idea what was going on.\n\nThey still charged us for the lamb and didn't apologize or offer us an alternative.\n\nWe paid our bill and left.\nDone deal. I felt really cheated and bad that the one time my mom and I get some time alone to have dinner together we ended up here.\n\nThe only saving grace is that BBQ King was just across the parking lot and a bowl of wonton soup there could chase these szechuan blues away.","delta.star":-2.5,"review.effect":"Negative","average.stars":"3.5","review.stars":"1","sentiment":-0.131454430738192,"Topic 1":0.00363129472018645,"Topic 2":0.0437777069218131,"Topic 3":0.00726912099941491,"Topic 4":0.269143339371091,"Topic 5":0.0125877241660688,"Topic 6":0.247948983066773,"Topic 7":0.0102992879180756,"Topic 8":0.00239430560709271,"Topic 9":0.0734570745802227,"Topic 10":0.00397011689477153,"Topic 11":0.157452590240389,"Topic 12":0.103821705009195,"Topic 13":0.0159246900448972,"Topic 14":0.00516952938159944,"Topic 15":0.0431525310784087},{"id":500,"body":"Decent chimichangas and good margaritas.\n\nHonestly, I probably wouldn't remember Casa de Lara enough to warrant a review if it weren't for the spiders.

The smell of falafel was a delicious draw, so we decided to stop in. \n\nThis is not a restaurant. This is a hub. \n\nThe small restaurant was full of good sights, smells, and the chatter of friendly people in languages I didn't understand. Women in headscarves talked animatedly to eachother while scooping up laughing children to sit on their laps. Families talked to all tables as they sat down to delicious food.  Behind the counter, herbed beef, chicken, and lamb sizzled as music from Jerusalem sounded over the system. \n\nMeet Izzat. He opened La Shish Kabob about two months ago after moving his family here from Jerusalem. When he invites you into his restaurant, it's like he's inviting you into his home. We gladly took a seat.\n\nSERVICE: Astounding. Very pleasant and hospitable, and when I realized that I had accidentally ordered something with onions and green peppers (my friend is allergic), they instantly made another one and apologized even though it was my err. Instead of the original lamb kebab that was ordered, he made something that was a little different to better suit my friend's food requirements, without even being asked. And it was delicious.\n\nFOOD: If you've never experienced good Middle Eastern food, experience it here. They have all of the classics, from falafel to baba ghannouj. The tabouli was out of this world (so much better than I make, I'm going to have to snag his recipe), with that clean and fresh parsley, lemon and olive oil flavor. \nThe kebab wraps (chicken and lamb) were flavorful and huge. They also sell the brand of mango nectar there that tastes like you're drinking a whole mango. Delicious. The baklavah and other goodies in the case looked mouth-watering, but I was too full. That comes on round 2.\n\nPRICE: This is the awesome part. A heaping portion of tabouli for two, two lamb kebab wraps, one chicken kebab wrap, and 4 mango drinks comes out to: $26. So cheap for not only the portion size, but the quality and freshness as well.\n\nWhen you walk into this place, you can feel that it's good people. If you stay, you'll quickly realize that it's good people, AND great food. When it's all over, you'll also see that it's all for a really affrodable price. I highly suggest giving this place some love, because it's one of the few places that will give it back.","delta.star":0.5,"review.effect":"Positive","average.stars":"4.5","review.stars":"5","sentiment":0.423252660079571,"Topic 1":0.0134427725374455,"Topic 2":0.0498859672299956,"Topic 3":0.0497374162252195,"Topic 4":0.0419045612562157,"Topic 5":0.0273007667644693,"Topic 6":0.0320670177816944,"Topic 7":0.218587844021212,"Topic 8":0.00738711288248274,"Topic 9":0.0310110779203424,"Topic 10":0.00912598928005302,"Topic 11":0.195668904100385,"Topic 12":0.230591370843622,"Topic 13":0.0119914200749764,"Topic 14":0.0227233420624875,"Topic 15":0.058574437019399},{"id":502,"body":"This is an excellent Roberto's.

Because we wanted a Reuben Sandwich and that was the plan we were sticking too.\n\nThe place looks like it must have looked 40 years ago but it's clean and maintained and looked like every generic restaurant looked like when I was a kid but it had this nostalgic feel to it.\n\nNow there's not much to say here because we had our grub and left. It wasn't a culinary exploration of any sort. But they had a twist on the Reuben Sandwich which I didn't expect but I loved it anyway.\n\nThey made it an open faced sandwich where you have the usual Russian dressing, the krout, the smoked-meat and then a heaping pile of cheese the whole thing is salamandered until the cheese is nice and toasty, some fries are added and raw veggies.\n\nMaking things better... they have CHERRY COKE.

You usually tend to get anywhere between 2 to 6 menu pages in most breakfast places... they have nearly 20. Insane! The selection is overwhelming and in a way, blissful as you can come back over and over and try new things.\n\nThey have the standard type of breakfasts you can usually get elsewhere, shakes, smoothies, various egg Benedict dishes, omelets, poutine breakfasts?!?, patati patata?!?, grilled cheeses, crepes, waffles, brioches, french toasts... etc. The lunch menu has sandwiches, salads and burgers... all in all, the choices are numerous.\n\nWe went with Le Petit Gourmand (eggs, bacon, sausage, banana/chocolate crepe) and Ole Coco (same thing with only standard crepes with a lot fruits) variety breakfasts. They were extremely good across the board. The eggs were done to perfection, the sausages were good and bacon was.... as good as bacon usually is. The fruits were of top quality and very fresh and the crepes were just right. \n\nThe coffee hit the spot and consequent refills were done quickly and efficiently. The extremely friendly and super accommodating waitress we had went above and beyond. The food came quickly and I was offered things you don't get elsewhere as much as you should.... normal maple syrup or the \"real kind\". I opted for the real kind and it was awesome.\n\nI noticed she was very familiar with her regular patrons, I thought it complimented the place a lot. I hope to get the same sort of treatment down the line as well.\n\nIn particular note, the bread is quite special and comes from Premiere Moison. It is of the superior variety with long thin slices of bread, toasted to perfection that truly complimented the meal we had. What an excellent idea.\n\nThe price tag is reasonable for what is offered.\n\nWill I come back? Absolutely!!!! Most likely this upcoming weekend and will probably be incorporated in our regular resto rotations if this excellence keeps up.

The only downside is that it always takes awhile to prepare, but at least that means it's fresh, no rolls that have been sitting around for us!","delta.star":0.5,"review.effect":"Positive","average.stars":"3.5","review.stars":"4","sentiment":0.131811094403631,"Topic 1":0.0151519066938645,"Topic 2":0.269167633204991,"Topic 3":0.0331180816993873,"Topic 4":0.285212483442631,"Topic 5":0.0536906799380229,"Topic 6":0.0330058359135477,"Topic 7":0.126672404442081,"Topic 8":0.00672311845039029,"Topic 9":0.0438650718141415,"Topic 10":0.00683347964555569,"Topic 11":0.0389805478237681,"Topic 12":0.0146982989982191,"Topic 13":0.00716159560344947,"Topic 14":0.041369014771602,"Topic 15":0.0243498475583494},{"id":536,"body":"The best place for a late night snack.

This has become something of a problem recently, as the Hereford Barn has closed down, and even several of the chain restaurants (Lone Star, Longhorn) have started closing too.  So I started looking about to find somewhere new to try.\n\nI finally settled on the Ranch House after reading some favorable reviews on the Internet.  I'm always a little leery about somewhere that I've never even seen, but I figured if we didn't like it, we could always turn around and go somewhere else.\n\nOnce inside, it's like you're transported back to a different time.  The dimly-lit interior could be from the 1950s (I'm guessing here).  The menu is relatively simple, with mostly steaks, and a bit of chicken and some seafood as well.  Steaks come with onion rings, salad, and your choice of baked potato or vegetable medley.\n\nIt is clear that the place makes their living cooking steaks, as there really isn't a lot of thought to the rest of the menu, so we decided to go that route.  One of the more intriguing options is the \"Dinner for 2\", which gives you a 22 ounce (sirloin) steak and all the fixings for two people, for a very reasonable price.  I also had a sirloin, the 10-ounce Ranch House Special.\n\nThe salads came out first - very quickly, I might add.  I chose the homemade blue cheese dressing, and it was awesome.  Easily the best blue cheese dressing I can ever remember having.  That really isn't saying much, as I can't remember ever having any other blue cheese dressing before, but it was really good.  I'd suggest going just for the dressing.\n\nThe steaks came out shortly after - really fast, in fact.  It seems that the fast cooking time is a direct relationship to the thickness of the steaks (they are very thin).  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as a thin piece of meat can be good.  And it wasn't bad, exactly, but it didn't have a lot of flavor, either.  In fact, the steak from Upstream was better.  Odd.\n\nEven the service was great.  It was just that the steak wasn't, which was a shame.","delta.star":-0.5,"review.effect":"Negative","average.stars":"3.5","review.stars":"3","sentiment":0.349522962010716,"Topic 1":0.0111862504330714,"Topic 2":0.238028439954628,"Topic 3":0.0174722358324659,"Topic 4":0.00718710450157092,"Topic 5":0.106184862348345,"Topic 6":0.112446541849748,"Topic 7":0.0499598829192216,"Topic 8":0.0179092492405755,"Topic 9":0.0174575914579075,"Topic 10":0.00492726257009694,"Topic 11":0.0436621576790487,"Topic 12":0.170739131380509,"Topic 13":0.107660750092923,"Topic 14":0.017458812706572,"Topic 15":0.0777197270333173},{"id":550,"body":"Zoup is a very interesting new restaurant!

After roaming down St. Paul for a few blocks, we found this little jazz spot, which turned out to be rather serendipitous.\n\nThe cover (on the two nights we went there, because if you find a cool little spot like this you have to go back a second time!) was extremely affordable - $7 the first time and $8 the second time. Most anywhere else in the US would have had a minimum cover of $20 for that level of talent.\n\nThe stage is by the front window, consisting of a piano (go figure!) and whatever instruments the bands want to bring in. If you're facing from the stage, there's an L-shaped bar in front of you, and a series of couches and box? chairs off to the right extending to the back of the room. And that, I must say is my only real complaint - the layout. It's not quite as intimate as one would like considering the atmosphere they're going for, and there isn't enough seats that have a view of the stage. But if you're happy just taking over a couple of back tables with friends and enjoying the music, it's perfect.\n\nThey have a fufu cocktail menu, all themed after, well, music. While I didn't have any of the on-menu cocktails (went for manhattans and gin martinis instead), my friends who did order off the menu were not disappointed.\n\nAs for the main attraction - the music - both nights we were not disappointed. The bands were amazingly talented, performing either jazz or jazzified covers (if I can coin a phrase). The second night we were there, there was a guest singer who belted out At Last so well Etta James may have risen from the grave to give her a round of applause.\n\nWe were there on off-nights (Wednesday & Thursday), so it was steady but not overly busy.

These little buns are dressed with this yummy garlic and oil concoction.  Although the bread itself doesn't taste very garlicky to be called a garlic twist, the garlic sauce stuff is worthy to bathe in.  I couldn't get enough of that stuff.  \n\nWe started with the Antipasto appetizer at $10.95.  This was a huge helping of artichoke hearts, roasted peppers, marinated mushrooms, olives, Provolone cheese and Prosciutto.  It tasted like there was some Mozzarella cheese as well in there.  The prosciutto wasn't exactly what we had in mind, but overall, it was a hearty helping that was more than enough for a party of two.\n\nPizza - We shared a small thin crust \"Sausage and Peppers\" pizza, at $9.95 (\"Mozzarella, our famous plum tomato sauce, topped with oven roasted peppers, sausage and freshly sliced garlic\").  We would have preferred if the pizza was in the oven longer, cooking the veggies and sausage a bit more.  The crust wasn't thin enough, in our opinion, especially for a restaurant that calls themselves \"New York Style Cuisine.\"  The pizza did taste a lot better the next day after we popped it in our toaster oven for a little while.\n\nWith the option to pick and choose your pasta and sauces at $9.95 a bowl, we ended up with the Angel Hair pasta and Garlic and Oil sauce.  We asked them to add some tomatoes in there too for a bit more color and taste.  I loved the slices of garlic in the pasta and it was a generous portion for what we paid.\n\nOverall, the service was average.  There was this one young Asian waitress that we noticed had excellent customer service skills and we wished she was our server.  We noticed that we were never told the specials of the day (we overheard the waitress telling another table), nor were we even offered the chance to look over the dessert menu (again, we noticed the waitress ask another table).  We did notice the staff of servers work as a team in helping each other clean up and set up.  However, should I return...I would try to get the female server to assist us.  \n\nIt was apparent who the owners were...a husband and wife team that manned the host desk and handled the register.  I'm not sure how long they have been in business, but it wouldn't hurt if they checked on the customers to see how we were enjoying their meal.

Their cash register was broken too.\n\nBut from my first taste of baklava, nothing else mattered but the food. The baklava is luscious. It's some of the best I've ever had. It's not gloopy and not cloyingly sweet. The taste of nuts and honey and flakey pastry all come through.\n\nThen I tried their veggie soup.

It was like 2p.m. so I decided to try a new place instead, Cilantro Tacos. This place hasn't been open long and to be honest, I never went in because of the name. I'm not a HUGE fan of cilantro so it was never really on my radar. Needless to say, cilantro is just a topping that you can ask to not have when you place your order so it's definitely not a big deal. Here's what I ordered for my wife and me and how it all stacked up. By the way, I have lived in California for about 6 years and have had Mexican food from many different places...so my descriptions are accurate :)\n\n1 Taco de pollo/chicken - Wife ordered this, so I just had a bite. Chunky pieces of chicken. Up to par with a standard Mexican place.\n\n1 Taco de al pastor/sauced pork - Wife ordered this, so again, I just had a bite. I'm not a fan of al pastor in general but from the bite I had, it was pretty good. Just the right amount of flavor to keep you coming back for more.\n\n1 Taco de carne asada/marinated steak - This is where it's at. Thick juicy cuts of carne asada packed with flavor. Depending on the sauce you get from the salsa bar, this can end up being a fantastic snack/meal(if you plan on having more than one).\n\n1 Taco de carnitas/pork - The carnitas I had at this place was probably some of the best carnitas I have ever had from any Mexican spot. Normally, when you order carnitas from any other place, you get small chunks of hardened pork that just doesn't do it for me. Cilantro Tacos carnitas is formulated of giant, soft, succulent pieces of pork with enough flavor to have me thinking about my next order for the subsequent time that I go. I don't know what I'll be getting the next time I go here, but one thing is for sure; At least one item that I end up getting will contain CARNITAS! lol :)\n\n1 Order of Cilantro Fries - Now, for the Main Course, we had the Cilantro Fries(for those that don't like Cilantro, don't let the name throw you off, this dish has practically nothing to do with cilantro). This dish starts off with a nice layer of french fries. On top of that, you have about half a gallon of cheese. On top of that you have thick cuts of carne asada. This is served with 2 small sides of guacamole and 1 small side of sour cream. If you play your cards right, you dump the 2 sides of guacamole diagnolly on opposite sides of the dish and dump the sour cream right in the middle. After going to town on these fries, I realized that my wife and I were fighting over who got the next bite. Next time I'll just get my own order. These were different from your standard carne asada fries in the sense that this was a little more gourmet. It didn't have as much asada as a standard place would have, but the quality made up for that. It also wasn't as salty as normal carne asada fries would be. I will definitely be having this dish again. \n\nAll in all, I have to give this place 5 stars for the following reasons;\n1.) Pricing is decent for the quality of food.\n2.) Meats(the ones that I like anyway - Carne Asada/Carnitas) were top notch and as I said before, \"If you're thinking of your next meal from the same place while you're eating, it's probably fantastic!\")\n3.) Decor was great! I'm not a fan of Mexican music, but they had that playing in the background. Plus the place was super clean inside.\n4.) 5 Stars - I plan on trying some other things on the menu and will drop the rating if I either don't like it or they start to slack. I don't see that happening any time soon though.\n\n1 Gripe: My wife wanted me to mention that she wishes this place had Huaraches because she'd be here all the time if they did, lol. \n\nAll in all, if you're looking for a fantastic Mexican place to simply grub or grab a snack, Cilantro Tacos is the place :D\n\nI am the first to review this restaurant so maybe I could get hooked up with a discount in the future, lol!","delta.star":1,"review.effect":"Positive","average.stars":"4","review.stars":"5","sentiment":0.201158840252192,"Topic 1":0.00416036415571631,"Topic 2":0.196841703079606,"Topic 3":0.0298845918149575,"Topic 4":0.0139151471348511,"Topic 5":0.0135842837520735,"Topic 6":0.0412270585690451,"Topic 7":0.0821974401704827,"Topic 8":0.003888210965485,"Topic 9":0.019397603800053,"Topic 10":0.337289570135994,"Topic 11":0.0870086412811635,"Topic 12":0.0610488426537892,"Topic 13":0.0774711634961103,"Topic 14":0.00582590303490083,"Topic 15":0.0262594759557723},{"id":576,"body":"Aloha:\nI have eaten Pete's since I was 6 month old 1951, it has not changed a bit.

The atmosphere is decidedly W, or painfully Scottsdale. It's got the color scheme of Sushi Roku, the vibe of a big city restaurant, and food for gods. \n\nIt is connected through the lobby of the hotel, but also has it's own entrance, something the other hotel restaurants in the area cannot say. District is also privately owned, so you won't fall victim to any Sheraton miscues in the restaurant here, just thier own which I have to say there aren't many so far. The restaurant is dark and mysterious in the lounge area, and completely open in the dining room, which makes for a great social atmosphere all around. They also feature local artists with the wall art changing monthly, and it's for sale too! I'm glad someone had the foresight to do that, rather than buy some mass produced crap from Malaisa. There is a private boardroom style dining room in the back, with two large semi private dining rooms, and another large dining table overlooking the restaurant, so large parties would be great in this space. I'm thinking the large table in the dining room is the best as you are almost on a king's throne above everyone.\n\nThe food follows the same cues as the atmosphere. It's familiar, but fun and exciting... they call it \"American Comfort\" and thats exactly what it is. The menu features Shrimp Po' Boy Sliders, Mussels which come in a ginormous bowl with an incredible sauce, Short Rib w/chipotle grits, salmon, steak, and other familiar dishes with a little local taste. Our table enjoyed everything including the Organic Berkshire Pork with Memphis BBQ sauce, Mac & Cheese, and Applesauce. Also on the table were the Mussels, and the Caesar Salad which might have been the only dissapointment. I ordered the Short Rib, and we all agreed it was one of the best we had ever tasted. They even made Grits delicous. It's obvious that quality has been taken into account as all of the vegetables and meats are locally produced and purchased from small farms. Queen Creek, The Farm at South Mountain, and Schreiner's are just some names that come to mind. The chef was kind enough to come out and introduce himself about mid-meal and I asked him where he came from, the answer pretty much explained the entire evening to me. He is the former Executive Chef of the late Mary Elaine's, Mr. Belosic, and he explained he was just having fun doing something people would be familiar with. There was a dish on the menu that literally everyone would be familiar with, from Fried Chicken or Cod, to a Ribeye. \n\nThe drink list is pretty standard on the wine side, but the beer list is much more unique, featuring almost solely microbrews from New Belgium, Oak Creek, and Widmer. There is even an organic beer on the list. Though I wasn't drinking last night, I thought $3.75 was enticing enough for a microbrew that I'd go back another day to enjoy.\n\nPerhaps the highlight of the night for me was when the bill came, not because I wanted to pay, but because like other restaurants they bring a little something with the tab. Most places do the apropos mints, chocolates, etc. Not District, nope, this place brings you a big cotton candy on a stick, a la the state fair from when I was a kid. How cool is that? The bill came out to about $60 w/o drinks for 3 people, which honestly we felt was very fair, almost as though it were an underpriced Mary Elaine's meal. My only, and I mean ONLY gripe with the restaurant is more with the narrow visioned architects who designed the space. The patio has about a 3.5' cement wall, which is just high enough to make the diner feel disconnected from the street. It would have been really nice to do something glass, or steel, to engage the street and encourage people watching... plus it would feel much less confined, but oh well. I'll go back again, and probably again after that, especially now that I've learned they feature live music Thursday through Saturday. \n\nKeep on Keepin' on District, and heres to hoping you open the floodgates of trendy, chic, urban hotspots in Downtown Phoenix.","delta.star":1.5,"review.effect":"Positive","average.stars":"3.5","review.stars":"5","sentiment":0.46131016114477,"Topic 1":0.0343706247906219,"Topic 2":0.0355173625719647,"Topic 3":0.27714647303173,"Topic 4":0.0139526953468352,"Topic 5":0.297445688622512,"Topic 6":0.0284216778082405,"Topic 7":0.0504074922637719,"Topic 8":0.0035611734324967,"Topic 9":0.00706519000320354,"Topic 10":0.00237956620980888,"Topic 11":0.0662195154025978,"Topic 12":0.0631917565101622,"Topic 13":0.015683037013333,"Topic 14":0.00454220884528844,"Topic 15":0.100095538147433},{"id":596,"body":"i don't know why jack in the box is hyped up so much, i blame george lopez for talking about them in his comedy skits.\n\nbad\nplace was very small, dark, slow service. food was edible (barely), i kept spitting out my hamburger b/c the meat was chewy.\n\ngood\ncheap\n\nwasted a dinner in vegas here...FAYUL","delta.star":-0.5,"review.effect":"Negative","average.stars":"2.5","review.stars":"2","sentiment":-0.363392173974867,"Topic 1":0.0145011056643883,"Topic 2":0.13122176951917,"Topic 3":0.0241572853610416,"Topic 4":0.00677516378658739,"Topic 5":0.0120440866054096,"Topic 6":0.506856299127004,"Topic 7":0.0164337804722086,"Topic 8":0.0141743636717907,"Topic 9":0.0243343927238096,"Topic 10":0.0093423153100651,"Topic 11":0.0737157867170957,"Topic 12":0.0351889338708763,"Topic 13":0.0724919131535739,"Topic 14":0.0151324428346686,"Topic 15":0.0436303611823109},{"id":597,"body":"A solid sandwich..

I got 2 sides with the ribs, 1 with the sandwich, and 2 cornbreads.  My bill was $20.  Compared to this kind of meal at Famous Dave's...I suppose it is on par.  The price is also what I would pay for this same meal at my all-time favorite bbq spot - Romy's Ribs.  \nWorth it?\nMy 1/2 slab didn't seem shabby nor generous.  Its a 1/2 and nothing more.  The ribs are meaty enough, so the 1/2 will probably do you just fine.  With the 2 sides and the cornbread, $11.99 is sensible.  The sandwich is actually quite generously piled with meat.  Bigger than Honey Bear's, bigger than Romy's even.  With the side...its worth $6.99.\nNow the quality:\nCreating perfect ribs has become a passion of mine the last few years, but EATING perfect ribs has always been one of my favorite past times.  The Co's ribs came with a very small amount of sauce poured right in the middle of the serving, which doesn't win points for presentation.  Picking a piece up, I noticed that the smoke ring was very thin, hardly penetrating the surface of the rib.  Not good for smoked ribs.  I bit into one and it gave that good chew that some people like and others don't.  In my opinion, the chew gives you something to do while you're eating:)  Decent texture.  Taste was...only ok.  I'm sorry too, because this is their main attraction.  Perhaps it was due to grand opening craziness, but it was as though the care wasn't put into seasoning the ribs like it should've been.  Not nearly smoky enough...nowhere near.  But not a bad taste at all...just ok.  The sauce doesn't take away from the taste, but it doesn't add to it either.  Forgettable sauce.\nThe pulled pork sandwich had a ton of meat on it, with the same bbq sauce splatted on top.  The presentation inside the styrofoam container was a bit better than the ribs, but still won no points.  This sandwich is the uiciest pulled pork I have ever had, and the most tender.  As far as taste though, it's downfall is the same as the ribs' - seasoning or lack thereof.  Perfectly cooked meat is nothing if it tastes like nothing.  I got some bits of skin and fat in mine which are meant to enhance the flavor, but those didn't have flavor either.  So unfortunate because this could've topped Romy's pulled pork.  Just season it!!!\nThe sides...I tried to pick the sides that let you know if a place is 'for real' or not.  I got greens, beans & rice, and potato salad.  I cannot give any of them a passing grade.  Surprisingly, the greens were the best of the 3, however they were way too chewy and tangy...  The beans and rice came with 3 different beans - red, lima and something else...had the same tang as the greens which isn't good; also no savoriness to them.  The potato salad is too chunky for its own good, almost to the point of questioning the doneness of the potatoes...but a good actual taste, though.\nSo if I have such complaints about the food, why give 3 stars?  Because I feel they will improve.  Someone who is very passionate about this community and local business (and who loves bbq) will go and have a talk with the owner at some point.  If the owner is any kind of a decent owner, they will listen.  The food is not bad.  It was just bland.  Keeping in mind that I saw a lot of younger people in and out of the kitchen, that this is ONLY THE GRAND OPENING, and that this is CHANDLER not St. Louis (or even Chicago)...I had to cut some slack.  If on my next few visits nothing has improved, they will be knocked down a star.\nService was nice.  The cashier had the opening day frizzles and she had probably been at it all day, but she did everything with a smile.  Smiles from the girl who gave me the food...and I only spent about 7 minutes in the place.  The layout of the place needs some work...diners too close to the ordering line is a huge pet peeve of mine.  And my butt was almost in some lady's beans and rice.  Looks nice enough inside, though.\nI am rooting for this place.  For one thing, if I have a local bbq place, I'm going to be a much happier person.  Also, I like to see new businesses flourish.  Get some seasoning on that meat, and NEVER EVER SKIMP ON THE SMOKE!!!!  C'mon Chandler BBQ CO, you can do it!!!","delta.star":0.5,"review.effect":"Positive","average.stars":"2.5","review.stars":"3","sentiment":0.475862065969144,"Topic 1":0.00537927825168137,"Topic 2":0.108108155658038,"Topic 3":0.0076871903985918,"Topic 4":0.0069059171139272,"Topic 5":0.0125298446187087,"Topic 6":0.188156023691139,"Topic 7":0.0422699936333146,"Topic 8":0.00771168827800791,"Topic 9":0.0193086089895706,"Topic 10":0.00408668727056407,"Topic 11":0.0866849225416024,"Topic 12":0.425582240006972,"Topic 13":0.0123829000036591,"Topic 14":0.0271892479490003,"Topic 15":0.0460173015952231},{"id":603,"body":"Thank you Doubletree hotel for this great recommendation :(    The only good part is that they delivered in under 30 minutes.

If you want the best pizza though, you have to go to the source, Naples. Naples Italy is where pizza evolved from a barely recognizable fisherman's meals of warm flat bread seasoned with olive oil and sardines, to what we've all come to recognize as contemporary pizza. A trip to Italy for a pizza may not be in everybody's budget though. \n\nFortunately, you don't have to go to Naples for authentic Naples pizza. If you live in Las Vegas, you can go to Settebello's.\n\nSettebellos is one of only 12 American pizzerias certified by the Verace Pizza Napoletana, an organization dedicated to the preservation authenticate Naples pizza by establishing rigid guidelines for preparation and ingredients, some of which seem to border on the ridiculous.\n\nThe dough can contain only four ingredients, flour, natural yeast, yeast of beer and water. The dough can only be worked with the hands, no rolling pins or machines allowed. The sauce has to be made from Italian grown tomatoes and the cheese can only be fresh buffalo mozzarella. The oven has to made from bricks imported from Italy and heated with a fire fueled only by wood.\n\nIs the result of all these harsh restrictions noting more than artifact and pretense? Is the end product an overpriced and mediocre discus of high falooting namby pandery?\n\nI SAY THEE NAY!\n\nSettebello's is the best pizza I've eaten within the borders of this nation, and the closest I've had to the pizza I had in Naples. The use of fresh ingredients and the dearth of artificial flavor enhancers and preservatives leaves the pizza with a crisp and bright flavor without the bitter acidity of cheap canned tomatoes. The dough has a smokey crunch that you can only get from a wood fired brick oven and the chewy mouth feel that requires manual kneading to develop gluten.\n\nDespite this attention to detail and lack of compromise on premium ingredients, Settebello won't put a hole in your wallet. A pizza will run you between $9 and $12 and while that's more expensive than Pizza Hut or Little Caesar's, if that's what you were looking for, you wouldn't be reading this. If you live in the Las Vegas area, or are just visiting, do yourself a favor and take a detour down to Henderson and give Settebello's a try.

We'd both heard rave reviews about this place from his sister in-law who frequents it out in the East valley.  We were looking forward to finally trying it out for ourselves.\n\nThe restaurant is in a neat little corner plaza surrounded by other great eateries, all of which share a really great courtyard patio with lots of community-style seating.  We entered the establishment from the courtyard, which is technically the back of the shop, and walked in to see what was in store for us.  The place was clean and brightly lit, with music blaring from the speakers.  It was definitely too loud, as we had to fight to not only hear each other, but also the people at the counter.  After we were greeted, I had to ask the counter people to repeat everything at least twice.  Not good, especially when my fianc\u00e9 overheard a girl on the prep line say to another customer that she couldn't hear what they said on account of the music.  After we decided on our sandwiches, we placed our orders and moved through the line.  I ordered a hot sub, the chipotle Philly chicken cheesesteak (or something to that effect) and my fiance ordered a turkey & provolone.  We were handed a ticket which only had my order written on it and it took us a minute to figure out they only write the hot sub orders and have you go through the assembly line for cold subs.  It took a while to get through the line; there was one girl adding toppings to the cold subs, one guy standing by waiting to wrap the finished subs in paper, and another girl running the register.  In addition, one woman was running the hot sub station on her own, the manager-type was taking cold sub orders, and another guy was mopping the floor (Really? With customers in the store?).  Something happened at the register, and I had to stand there for ten minutes waiting for my receipt.  By that time, we had my fianc\u00e9's sub but were still waiting for mine.  The woman running the hot station started calling the name Roger. When no one responded to that name, she came out onto the floor and started asking everyone personally if they were Roger.  She just kind of stood there looking confused, so I thought to ask her what kind of sub she had prepared.  Turns out, it was my sub.  The name we had given, which was also on the ticket, was Bryan.  Yeah, not even close.  By that point, we'd been in there for close to 20 minutes and were very underwhelmed by the service we'd been given.  We took our food home to (hopefully) enjoy it.\n\nThe subs weren't bad.  They weren't great, either.  I expected my hot sub to be full of flavor and spice, but instead it was just a chicken sub with peppers, a bit too much cheese, and not much in the way of the chipotle mayo that should have been on it.  Bryan's turkey and provolone wasn't anything to write home about.  The bread on both of our sandwiches was average - soft all around and soggy with all of the condiments.  Neither came close to being as great as Jimmy John's, and for what I paid, I would go to Subway over Jersey Mike's.  I really hope this place makes some improvements to their customer service, and at the very least, they should turn down the music a few notches - that might help with the communication issues.","delta.star":-1.5,"review.effect":"Negative","average.stars":"3.5","review.stars":"2","sentiment":0.108446351099166,"Topic 1":0.0067631931718406,"Topic 2":0.0909404798397521,"Topic 3":0.0620765763100452,"Topic 4":0.00343381012271349,"Topic 5":0.00440623504657197,"Topic 6":0.0511124534253891,"Topic 7":0.0402080211532909,"Topic 8":0.00516717763695619,"Topic 9":0.0108686938077535,"Topic 10":0.0176550892000894,"Topic 11":0.446031176597123,"Topic 12":0.0117393601983938,"Topic 13":0.0302330501352281,"Topic 14":0.212911928427081,"Topic 15":0.00645275492777109},{"id":632,"body":"4 stars for Hardee's ?!?

For weeks every time I walked by I whispered \"please have shrimp rissois on the menu, please have shrimp rissois on the menu, please have shrimp rissois on the menu\".\n\nOur group of friends decided we would all go together and last night was finally the night! \n\nTHE SHRIMP RISSOIS ARE LOVELY!!! Prayers: answered.  The beauty of these little handmade fried dumplings is the crispy breaded outside with the creamy shrimpy goodness inside.  They're high on my list of comfort foods. \n\n I had the Bacalhau com natas... what a lovely plate of cod with a cheesy creamy topping,  generous portion too with black olive garnish mmm... The food was all piping hot when it got to the table.  The chorizos were flamb\u00e9d right at the table!! (And all who tried it said it was delicious and not greasy) two of our friends had a steak and cheese sandwhich with a spicy gravy and a fried egg on top - that looked amazing... two had the pork and beef skewers and commented that the spice rub was just right, flavorful with heat, but not overpowering.  My sister in law had steak with potatoes and an egg, she was impressed at how perfectly the steak was done to her order (medium rare)... \n\nWe didn't even wait for our mains to make our verdict - after the appetisers (the afore mentioned rissois, along with cod cakes and 2 chorizos) we had decided we were definitely coming back.  \n\nThe wait staff were helpful and attentive, I had trouble deciding between the two bacalhau dishes and with a single question \"do you like salty food\" our waitress helped me decide.  I've never had bacalhau com natas before and wasn't sure what to expect, while I want to try more dishes, I know that's a solid go-to for me next time I'm there. \n\nWe were all surprised, with the size of our meals - 6 mains, 6 or 7 starters - at the size of our check - only \u00a399!! It's BYOB but still, that was a nice surprise.  \n\nWe live in the neighborhood and Tugas is always fairly packed so I'd advise making a reservation.\n\nTugas Amor will, if it hasn't already, outgrow it's space, I hope it doesn't leave the neighborhood, but when and if it moves, I will happily go cross town for a fix.","delta.star":1,"review.effect":"Positive","average.stars":"4","review.stars":"5","sentiment":0.436312756817552,"Topic 1":0.0267225324643109,"Topic 2":0.0258760975779591,"Topic 3":0.0345837814593013,"Topic 4":0.0366934876512487,"Topic 5":0.212742596516661,"Topic 6":0.0133330367141346,"Topic 7":0.161997272810318,"Topic 8":0.00480472205994857,"Topic 9":0.0191513522889007,"Topic 10":0.0243010530594435,"Topic 11":0.201652696844478,"Topic 12":0.134614039123494,"Topic 13":0.0580825058015077,"Topic 14":0.0158386760263639,"Topic 15":0.0296061496019302},{"id":643,"body":"KFC finally in Montreal.....

I checked the menu last year while preparing for the Olympia Weekend Expo. With this being one of the then 2-time (about to be 3-time) Mr. Olympia, Jay Cutler's, spots, my boyfriend and I thought it would only be appropriate to have a bonzai bowl after the Expo. \n\nSadly, we planned badly because we visited the day after Jay won his 3rd title and learned that Bonzai Bob's was not open on Sundays. \n\nLesson learned, we showed up this year on Saturday. \n\nNow, people will say time and time again that a business' service is great and sometimes (especially in LA) that might mean the staff leaves your alone or just smiles once in a while. In Bonzai Bob's case, the service is more than great. It's tremendous. The staff was warm and welcoming, as if they were very happy for each person they'd be able to feed that day. We had a party of five and the tables are mostly two and four-tops so we happily pulled an extra chair up. One of the staff members insisted we just pull up another table so we could spread out and even started pulling the table over herself. My boyfriend and I ordered together and both asked for fountain drinks to which the cashier replied, \"or, you know, you guys can just share the drink...\" I've never heard anyone say that before and, given that this is usually what happens on the downlow anywhere else, I really appreciated the generosity. (We kept the order at two drinks since we already asked for it and didn't want to make him go in and change it)\n\nThe menu is a healthy eater's dream. You realize very quickly why an elite bodybuilder would frequent such a place, but it should also become apparent to anyone that everyone should eat at such a place. I usually hate eating out when I'm not on a cheat meal because it's impossible to get enough protein without having to order extra sides of meat. Restaurants seemingly hate to give you enough protein (seriously, some portions are joke!) Bonzai Bob's not only gives you the protein you need, they put it out there. Their Bonzai Bowl boasts 80 grams of protein and it's very easy to see that they give you all 80 grams. There were chunks of meat in every bite of food we took. You can opt for a bowl, which includes meat (chicken, shrimp, or steak), fresh veggies (broccoli, carrots, zucchini- there are what I remember off the top of my head) and a choice of brown or white rice. Yakisoba bowls give you the meat and veggies on noodles. Low carb bowls cut the rice. Or you can opt for a salad of wrap. You can add spice, onions, or garlic to your liking (double up the garlic, go low on spice, whatever) and it'll be made to your liking. \n\nI the Smalls Special, which includes veggies, steak, and shrimp on yakisoba, with garlic, onions, and hot spice. I added sriracha and soy sauce at the table for some personal tweaks, but I was completely satisfied with my meal. If you're feeling adventurous, famished, or in need of a boost, you can do what my boyfriend did and order the Triple O bowl, which is a Jay Cutler specialty (which I'm assuming will soon be renamed to reflect his 4th win!). This has white meat chicken, veggies, and onions on white rice in a mega sized portion- the biggest bowl they offer. It was easily 3 or 4 times larger than my bowl and it was filled. The chicken pieces were huge and generously mixed in. \n\nThe location is perfect- in the same plaza as a gym and tanning salon- so I hope they have tons of regulars. \n\nIn short, we're hooked and will plan a trip back then next time we find ourselves in Vegas!","delta.star":0,"review.effect":"Neutral","average.stars":"5","review.stars":"5","sentiment":0.444683029674719,"Topic 1":0.0125451435213207,"Topic 2":0.0684341506546542,"Topic 3":0.0101884836448497,"Topic 4":0.0657878999576722,"Topic 5":0.0160972652789267,"Topic 6":0.0371579196393827,"Topic 7":0.0619716073461093,"Topic 8":0.00524662536272632,"Topic 9":0.135225018244122,"Topic 10":0.00388472179605066,"Topic 11":0.238920575950195,"Topic 12":0.0716851183018627,"Topic 13":0.0693397899869723,"Topic 14":0.108471985747753,"Topic 15":0.0950436945674035},{"id":668,"body":"Stopped by after reading Darren's review.

The previous bbq that was in this location was only open about one to two months and closed.  The building owner worked with Swhinery to open up. \n\nwww.facebook.com/theswhinery\n\nThe bar area does allow smoking not including the smoke from the smoked meat.  The restaurant in the back room is non-smoking. \n\nSwhinery bbq has won awards at many bbq cook offs up and down the east coast.  Check out their facebook page and look at the banners on the side of the building.\n\nThe food is good.  The Blackened tuna with sesame had some nice flavors and definitely had sesame favor, was cooked perfectly and was a great meal.  The ribs are good.  The ribs come with the Swhinery bbq sauce that is a little sweet but has some sharpness.  There is a Hot Swhinery bbq sauce that I preferred.  Also, a mustardy Carolina sauce is available.

Yes, I only ate here once, but I got the idea that the circle of cilinary hell I was in was typical.\n\n- 1 Star - Wierdly dark.  Came in at 2pm on a weekday and what lights were on (most those over the bar were OFF), were dimmed down to the strip-club level.  To encourage more drinking?  To save electricity? Just flat out weird.\n- 1 Star - Horrible, dreadful food.  A quesadilla should not be served cut up in to slices and stacked on top of each other if the slices are so watery with oil, so underdone, so glutinously sticky that each slice cannot be pulled away from that below it.  And what's with the bizarre \"chipolte\" sauce poured over my stacked mass?  It was like watery mayo with orange coloring.  Foul beyond words.  The pico de gallo was okay, though!  But then there was the side salad.  Old tasting lettuce, chunks of flat-fridge-tasting tomato and croutons that came out of a stale bag left open since... not sure when.  I don't think I have left a salad untouched in years, until today.  How was the dressing for the salad?  Oh, hi, nice to see you Mister Plastic Bottled blue cheese.  \n- 1 Star/ + 1 Star - Server.  I sat at the bar, and with about 12 stools available, there was only one other taken, so it was not busy.  The bartender was attentive, not neglectful.  But there could have been some warmth, some pleasantry?  Right?  I mean, take a few moments to ask... something beside the basics - whatcha want?  No?\n+ 1 Star/-1 Star - The music.  It's like the 80's are alive, and kicking here at the ole Sangria.  Sort of cool but not as this is just not *that* sort of place.\n- 1 Star - The Price.  Once again, as with the other eaterie on property, it's like they know they have you by the short-hairs.  A quesadilla and small salad for about $20, without any drink (water! free!)?  Ridic.\n\nThere isn't much more to say about this place other than it is the 2nd restaurant on the premises of the Scottsdale Resort and Conference Center.  I understand that the pool bar (which was not open the few days I was here) serves food from Sangria's, so SSDD is the vibe.  What Sangria's and it's snazzier (but still crappy) sister joint, the Palm Court, need is a food facelift.  They could get away with being mediocre in so many other ways (decor, out-dated vibe in general) if the food was good.  But it's not even fresh! \n\nThis resort needs to step up their food game.  Maybe they can get away with serving slop to the conventioneers, but the fact that they had rooms available at last minute notice when the rest of Scottsdale was booked up speaks mightily to the poverty of their food quality.  Again, a sad \"avoid\" vote.","delta.star":-2,"review.effect":"Negative","average.stars":"3","review.stars":"1","sentiment":-0.116918853583568,"Topic 1":0.010095541266526,"Topic 2":0.0492854871422537,"Topic 3":0.204355879693415,"Topic 4":0.00431046176067608,"Topic 5":0.0659598900695904,"Topic 6":0.311348409310852,"Topic 7":0.0177438761601392,"Topic 8":0.0138856035760265,"Topic 9":0.00945637729702105,"Topic 10":0.0412260595883829,"Topic 11":0.114258460332539,"Topic 12":0.042349173612771,"Topic 13":0.0110653448483876,"Topic 14":0.0858609664647444,"Topic 15":0.0187984688766751},{"id":670,"body":"Excellent place to eat for lunch (or maybe even dinner). \n\nThis is a new casual eatery opened on Gibson Rd in Henderson.

Just like the name implies...you get pastrami here in addition to other succulent sandwiches.\n\nThe portions are HUGE!!! I got a \"small\" which felt like an XL pastrami. I am originally from the East coast, so let me tell you when I say that it was the best pastrami that I've ever had, it means a lot. The meat was tender, but not too much so, spicy but not overkill.

Our waiter (I'm assuming Frank) came over with chips, salsa, and menus right away.  A+ on the chips and salsa.  An extensive menu (with all-day breakfast... which won Megans heart immediately) made our mouths start watering.  After waffling back and forth over the seemingly better and better choices, Megan finally settled on chicken soup & ropa vieja & I got the al pastor.  We also ordered some guacamole &, of course, margaritas to pass the time.  The guac & soup came out with some supplemental chips and damn were they tasty. Megans soup had large chunks of vegetables floating in it, and our waiter was happy to identify them all for us.  The guacamole was creamy and fresh and hit the spot after a day of dragging 30 lbs of gear through hot canyons.  Our plates came out shortly after... the ropa vieja was juicy as promised, and the al pastor had a great bite to it that really lingered on  the palate.\n\nFrank & Fina's is now our de facto mexican go to place in Vegas.

I am a HUGE fan of those ginormous New York Reubens, and have yet to find one that even comes CLOSE in Pittsburgh to living up to its claim.\n\nSo after the theater today, we decided to try Sammy's.  From the outside, it has always looked very NY delicatessen, and I expected to find that kind of atmosphere inside.  Man, was I ever mistaken.  \n\nFor a place that from the outside boasts fanatically about it's famous corned beef, the interior certainly didn't reflect that.  It's...a bar.  From the outside, the place looks huge.  From the inside, it's 3/4 bar, and a row of tall tables along the windows,  a few regular sized tables, and in this case a 'few' is an accurate count...there was one large round, and two two-tops.\n\nThere was no table service, only a sandwich counter at the back.  And basically, all they do is make sandwiches.  They have no real cooking equipment. They have a bunch of metal tins, a fridge for sodas, beer and basic sides like potato salad, and rack after rack of potato chips.\n\nI asked for a Reuben...but they don't MAKE Reubens.   They don't even toast bread, let alone grill it.\n\nI am totally perplexed how a joint raving about their own corned beef via giant glowing neon signs would NOT make THE most famous of all corned beef sandwiches in the world.\n\nThe guy behind the counter slapped two sandwiches together...oh...and one other piece of equipment they have...no grill, fryer, or heating unit...but they sure do have a SCALE to make sure your meat portion is exact.  The sandwich was in a little plastic basket with wax paper, and the basket didn't need to be anything else BUT 'little', because as far as I was concerned, it was a perfect match to the sandwich.  The Kosher dill quarter in the basket was more generous than the sandwich.\n\nTheir beverage options are all Pepsi products, canned or fountain, or alcohol.  \n\nAnd, as is typical for the burgh, several TV screens, all playing some sports coverage.  How unique and original.\n\nNow, I'm not saying the corned beef was bad.  It was actually fairly good.  I will NOT go so far as to use the word 'famous' to describe it.  It was adequate.  The price wasn't bad, but quite frankly I would be more impressed paying a few dollars more and getting an actual impressive sandwich.  \n\nFor all the glitz on the outside of the restaurant raving about the famous quality of the food, Sammy's really isn't much more than another Pittsburgh beer hall...with a sandwich counter.","delta.star":-2.5,"review.effect":"Negative","average.stars":"3.5","review.stars":"1","sentiment":0.173507643278941,"Topic 1":0.0109430285400422,"Topic 2":0.0755787116156957,"Topic 3":0.173831746198332,"Topic 4":0.00348094556743658,"Topic 5":0.0128999745862771,"Topic 6":0.0783827731283055,"Topic 7":0.0211765434652059,"Topic 8":0.0122132847222165,"Topic 9":0.00498484065386647,"Topic 10":0.00602442230438694,"Topic 11":0.104070480196796,"Topic 12":0.141201970151437,"Topic 13":0.0845566578649772,"Topic 14":0.171341620529339,"Topic 15":0.0993130004756861},{"id":686,"body":"*****THIS RESTAURANT IS NOW CLOSED***** (We were there on closing night, by chance, and heard it from the owners' daughter's mouth- it was time for them to retire). \n\nIt's hard to choose between Silver Dragon and Gourmet House of Hong Kong.

Finally, the day has come when it was mine to try. Fox Concepts are hit and miss with me, as some of the ones I love are super cheesy (Olive and Ivy, Modern Steak, Bloom), and some that I don't love are ones that are extremely popular (Sauce, Blanco, and Zinburger.)\n\nWhat sets Arrogant Butcher apart from the rest is it is the first downtown Phoenix restaurant that Fox RC has put out there. I'm sure they are nervous, and you can tell that from the design of the restaurant... it's much smaller than normal like they are testing the waters, yet in other ways it excels in the money spent meter. Three beautiful private dining rooms, a chef's counter facing the exhibition kitchen which they spared no expense on, and a great four sided bar in the middle. The atmosphere is a definite throwback to the 40's and 50's, which is nice considering you can't find that in many places downtown. It's truly a feel of an old tavern and restaurant. \n\nArrogant Butcher went out of their way to support local. Almost all of the beers on the tap as well as on the bottle list are Arizona breweries, there are pictures all over the restaurant of historic Phoenix landmarks and famous people, and they have done a great job of engaging the street with the patio and entrance. Yup, Sam Fox, the guy who is building a national empire of restaurants, brought downtown Phoenix a place that gives a nice sense of community.\n\nAs for the food, all apprehensions were set aside when the bowl of mussels in wine sauce with spicy pork shoulder, roasted grape tomatoes, and french fries came to the table. The dish was outstanding and had me wishing I could drink the broth. My main course of the crab stuffed chicken, served cordon blue style, with myers lemon and capers was also a very well executed dish. It was served with sauteed spinach underneath which I ate ridiculously quick. Other items on the menu sounded great, and AB offers a list of meats and cheeses, as well as a daily special that rotates weekly, and a nice array of sandwiches and salads for lunch. The desserts are fantastic as well, especially the peanut butter cup dessert, which is not served the way you would think it is, and includes cookies for dipping. \n\nSo no, this restaurant is not a locally owned, mom and pop style place, but rather it is a restaurant with a formula that is crowd pleasing, set in a location that could really use something of it's type, with the power to draw people in by the numbers. My biggest impression? on the first dinner service night, there were absolutely no hiccups in service. Our waitress, bussers, and drink people were all absolutely spot on.

It is truly amazing being able to watch this business take off right in my backyard and I wish them the best of luck!\n\nFor those who have never been, PDQ (And \"Tenders\" for that matter) does chicken, and that's about it.

I still remember my first bite into chicken tenders from PDQ about a year and a half ago, all that I could think of was \"WOW.\" You will have to try it for yourself. Their combos typically come with french fries that alone are worth a 20 mile trip to get.\n\nThe restaurant itself has a very modern and inviting feel to it. It can get a little loud inside but the buzz is all part of the PDQ vibe: Lively & Fun! In the dining area you will find a new Coke Freestyle machine that allows you to customize your drink to your liking. You like Grape Sprite? No Problem! Cherry Vanilla Dr. Pepper? They got it! My absolute favorite part of the building itself is a first for me in a restaurant: a hand washing station conveniently between the ordering station and drinks. It's great for when you don't need to use the restroom facilities (because who likes touching that dreaded restroom door handle) but still need clean hands. It struck me as a thoughtful yet common sense addition to any restaurant. Bravo PDQ!\n\nIf you take anything from this, remember this: Your visit to PDQ will be a unique experience.

The following day I came, and the place was closed due to the plaza cutting the power to the building.  I am sympathetic to the new business, and I am not easy deterred.  I was going to \"get my Congee on\" - and I wouldn't stop until I did.  I made my plans and tried again...\n\nFor the uninitiated...  what is Congee?  Congee is a Chinese rice porridge.  A comfort food staple of Chinese cuisine, it's often served plain with a bunch of side dishes (which they do not do here) or with ingredients such as pork, chicken or fish already inside (which Happy Valley's does do) and is a stand alone meal in itself.  For many Chinese people, if they are sick, they will seek out Congee the way many westerners may look for chicken noodle soup.  It is also a common breakfast staple in that part of the world.\n\nNow back to the story: when the time came and the stars were finally aligned, I was somewhat surprised by the atmosphere of the place.  The vibe was more of a lounge or bar than a regular sit-down restaurant, but it does have \"Congee & Bar\" in the name, so maybe I should not have been surprised.  Also, the music was very loud (and this makes me feel old to write that, but it's true).  There were not a lot of people in the place, so it was easy for the host to find me an open booth.  It was 12:30 a.m. (yes, I am willing to go to great lengths to get the Congee I want) and the music from the club next door could be heard thumping through the wall - but it didn't matter.\n\nI quickly familiarized myself with the menu, but a number of items were not available.  For example, the 1 lb of Salt and Pepper Chicken Wings intrigued me (since for $5.99 it would be one of the cheapest options available every day for Chicken Wings in town) but they were not available as of yet.  But I digress...  I ordered an order of the Century Egg and Pork Congee and a Hong Kong Style Milk Tea (interestingly enough, my server told me that they do not have regular Chinese tea) and soon my prayers were answered.\n\nA perfect bowl of Congee appeared, and through the magic of food I was transported through space and time to the Hong Kong of my youth, the Century Egg a great complement to the salty flavour of the pork.  There were bits of crispy fried wonton skin on top, which gave it some additional texture (Congee purists would no doubt expect to have that crispiness to be provided with a side order of Chinese Dough Fritters accompanying their Congee, but alas there are none to be found at Happy Valley's, at least not with the rather limited menu they do have available at this time).  I thought the Tea was a bit of a miss.  I also added an order of the Salt and Pepper Deep Fried Tofu, but in the end they were missing any discernible flavour besides salt, and I took them home to have later.  I figured they would be better with some sort of sauce.\n\nBut I will be back for the Congee, of this I have not doubt.  All the best to Happy Valley's Congee & Bar another great addition to the ethnic food choices we now have available in Waterloo.","delta.star":0.5,"review.effect":"Positive","average.stars":"3.5","review.stars":"4","sentiment":0.353372779392206,"Topic 1":0.0155767680923708,"Topic 2":0.0717978446490109,"Topic 3":0.0974643059462453,"Topic 4":0.24559123043983,"Topic 5":0.0142043778595137,"Topic 6":0.0183325988605589,"Topic 7":0.0626113219004137,"Topic 8":0.0162917439712388,"Topic 9":0.146589053828238,"Topic 10":0.00203484405981895,"Topic 11":0.110875012428268,"Topic 12":0.0230015218246442,"Topic 13":0.0067476096153918,"Topic 14":0.00626341273442082,"Topic 15":0.162618353790036},{"id":732,"body":"The food presented at their soft opening was fantastic.

There is a restaurant which seems to do pretty good business. I popped in before 7 on a Friday for a takeaway and it was pretty full which is always a good sign, with lots of other popping in to collect takeaway too.\n\nTheir takeaways are awesome. First visit at New Years was for meal deal for 2 and we added extra bits (pakora, naan, extra rice) on to make it a meal for 3 - seriously, there was tons of food, even feeding three with pub munchies, meant there was still another meal and a bit left for another day. Meat is cooked amazingly - we had a chicken korma and there was a lamb dish with mint whose name escapes me. I would never order lamb normally and didn't intend on even trying it but it was awesome. Totally melt in the mouth gorgeousness. \n\nI tried to look for it last night but probably missed it on the menu due to tiredness and starvation so I opted for a chicken dupiaza. It was lovely, subtly spiced tomatoey sauce with huge chunks of tender chicken and slices of red and green peppers and onions - yum! I ordered boiled rice to go with it and when I opened the bag at home, not only did I have my order, but a 2 little tubs containing a chopped onion salad and some mango chutney. I think this is a Jashans thing as there is always some kind of salad and sauce thing that comes extra which is a nice touch. \n\nSo, yep, Jashans is worth checking out. There are deals on for the restaurant on Sundays, and lunchtimes during the week,if you fancy a bargain lunch treat. The staff are lovely and the restaurant is really nicely decorated, very modern, but with lots of red, orange and gold accents to reflect the Indian and Bangladeshi theme.","delta.star":0,"review.effect":"Neutral","average.stars":"4","review.stars":"4","sentiment":0.456730193589663,"Topic 1":0.0176131913704347,"Topic 2":0.095174458114032,"Topic 3":0.0574133275105607,"Topic 4":0.0464903156991132,"Topic 5":0.0766536044711009,"Topic 6":0.019085591358546,"Topic 7":0.133068981880213,"Topic 8":0.0103569853740071,"Topic 9":0.193808548890742,"Topic 10":0.0065186270131013,"Topic 11":0.0673132937182291,"Topic 12":0.154440011354105,"Topic 13":0.014615146294426,"Topic 14":0.0186531884639859,"Topic 15":0.0887947284874029},{"id":738,"body":"We've eaten here a few times, and the food was always good.

I was there last week with some guys I used to work with and since we were getting the \"band back together\" we decided to hit up this South Hills institution because we were an institution of sorts years ago.  We got there at about 930 PM last Tuesday.  This is an immediate plus because many non major chain restaurants don't serve food past 9 or 10 PM during the weekdays in the burbs'.  The kitchen is open here until 11 PM.  The space itself is pretty cool.  It very much has a local watering hole feel to it.  They have valets that work during the dinner rush to park your car promptly with a smile.  In the Summer they have a patio area that is perfect for al fresco dining.  The interior itself is homely with dark wood, moderate lighting and the decorations on the walls are authentic and not the mass produced types at tj mcfunsters.  There is seating in both upstairs and downstairs and it is cozy while still providing privace from the table next to you.  On Tuesday we all sat at the bar and there was a pretty packed bar (surprising on a winter tuesday for most places, but I'd guess not this place), but all 5 of us were able to eventually get a seat.  The patrons were young and old, suits and jeans and for the most part friendly even though it was clear initially we weren't part of the usual clique'.  The food is nothing spectacular, but it is solid 3 star dining a step above olive garden and casual chain and not quite fine dining.   They had guiness on tap with always warms my heart.  The wine selection was decent and reasonably priced.  I was able to get a couple pours of a decent red malbec for under $10 per glass.  My buddies were able to find a few okay scotches to choose from and I think they had glenlivet and glenfiddich I think up to 24 yr. old.  The bartender, sarah I believe was very good, attentive and friendly.  This is the kind of bartender that makes it easy to grab a burger and a beer by yourself at a bar.  I started with a cup of the sherry crab bisque, which was a lot better than the last I had here.  It was thick and creamy without being too thick.  It also had noticeable chunks of crab.  I then had the chedder burger which was a big burger on a warm perfectly toasted bun oozing with cheese, however I wasn't asked how I would like it prepared so it was a little overcooked for my tastes.   I substituted asparagus for fries for $.50 more.  The asparagus were tiny and not that good, but I guess it's not the season.  Mike had the seared ahi tuna which was pretty good and better quality than I would have expected.  I think Trevor, Lloyd and Rob literally ordered everything on the appetizer menu.  I tried one of the caribbean shrimp which was a pretty good not overcooked large shrimp with tasty coconut breading.  They also had the mini burgers, pot roast nachos (pretty good I'd suggest trying), fromage dip (forgettable) and a few other things.

While we'll miss the charm and $2.79 breakfast of Katz Deli, the refurbishment of this pearl of a 60s building north of Camelback warrants commendation.\n\nThe original cinder-block and brick edifice has been preserved, but the remaining vestiges of Katz's greasy blue-boothed diner-feel have gone away.  The stained concrete floor is shined up to reflect the myriad votive candles dotting nearly every ledge space.  A view across the 1,000 square-foot, one-room design reveals smart furniture and several table arrangements: plush booths, a coffee table and vintage chair lounge, traditional wooden two and four-tops, high bistro tables, the long concrete bar inside, and the matching concrete bar on the back of the restaurant, where a comfortable patio meets the inside space with large windows that swing up and open. The large glass doors facing Central Ave. also open to create a breeze from front to back. (You definitely feel that the design of Postino Arcadia informed the restoration of Postino Central.)\n\nMy yelper-friend K.G. brought me to a fundraiser here on Saturday night, and though the full menu from Postino Arcadia wasn't available, the pinot noir and chardonnay that were selected for the event were strong choices.\n\nThe familiar array of bruschetta and the stand-by cheese platter served on the bar/communal table were abundant and tasty.  My personal favorites remain the tomato, basil, and mozzarella; the warm artichoke spread; the roasted peppers and goat cheese; and the ricotta with dates & pistachios.  Postino continues to succeed with cheeses that retain distinctive and memorable flavor.  This is defiantly not one-taste-fits-all cheese.\n\nFrom the dessert tray of Tammie Coe delights, I grabbed what I thought was a Russian Tea Ball but soon found out this was a decadent, sell-your-soul chocolate truffle dusted in powdered sugar.  With the pinot chaser, oh, dear me...it was close-your-eyes good.\n\nThe servers were in full force with at least 10-15 prim and polished attractive bartenders, runners, wine-glass fillers working the front of the house for the event.  We liked Stevie with the hipster hat and fun haircut the best.  His most memorable rejoinder when we hesitated at his request to fill our glasses again was \"I'm just going to pour it in.  You don't even have to drink it.\"  Occasionally you'd see front and back of the house mingling through the order-up slot window into the kitchen.  Foodies of Phoenix want to see the chefs working their magic.\n\nNow on to the restroom.  The sliding doors to the mens and ladies are frosted.  The circular tiles throughout cause a double-take as does the deep sink.  Noticeably absent is a mirror, and I imagine this will be remedied by the March 30 official opening of the winebar.  But without a mirror to inspect my red-wine teeth, I was a self-conscious swiller.\n\nPostino Central is a three-minute walk from the light rail stop at Camelback and will be a mainstay hangout for CenPho mavens who enjoy wine and open-air lounging.\n\nAfter the Grand Opening, I'll return to see how they're doing as a winebar with full menu, and I imagine my star rating will reach 5.","delta.star":-0.5,"review.effect":"Negative","average.stars":"4.5","review.stars":"4","sentiment":0.357967629449459,"Topic 1":0.161363831385728,"Topic 2":0.015254463505688,"Topic 3":0.353786342990152,"Topic 4":0.00132912609300731,"Topic 5":0.227088678223004,"Topic 6":0.00897889811936895,"Topic 7":0.0248608078766474,"Topic 8":0.0256517630414927,"Topic 9":0.000644645776595503,"Topic 10":0.000822701026115728,"Topic 11":0.0879410650846043,"Topic 12":0.022929087268831,"Topic 13":0.00645340162661727,"Topic 14":0.0174958747671219,"Topic 15":0.0453993132150264},{"id":744,"body":"My order was simple: two large pepperoni pizzas and a two-liter of coke.

The best way I can describe it is to say that it \"fits\" in North Scottsdale. Although Cantina Laredo is not (as of yet) a chain restaurant, it definitely has the polished, upscale, corporate feel of let's say, for example, Cheesecake Factory... but it's quality Mexican food.\n\nEvery time I've ended up at Cantina Laredo it's been lunch... as odd as that happens to be for me. On one hand, this means I've had the benefit of lunch portions and lunch prices... on the other hand, it means I've never seen the diner menu (I'm assuming the short menu I have seen with the low prices was for lunch only). As of writing this review, there are many excellent two item lunch combos for $7.99.\n\nAs with most Mexican resturants, the meal began with tortilla chips and two kinds of salsa... only this time when they said one of the salsas was \"hot\" they actually meant temperature. They were equally spicy, but one was served warm. The flavors of the salsa varied greatly, which was appreciated.\n\nThe first time I dined, I had two cheese enchiladas with rice and beans (of which you get a choice between three varieties). I was nervous when the plate came to the table because it looked like they were drowning in red sauce, but they turned out to be excellent. The cheese managed to keep a great deal of flavor and the sauce turned out to be thicker than it first appeared.\n\nToday for lunch, I had a cheese enchilada and beef taco combo. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the beef was what many other lesser Mexican restaurants would describe as \"steak\" although it also felt a little drier than I would've liked it. I still managed to \"clean my plate\", hence the positive review. My dining companion had a chicken enchilada and chicken taco combo and was very pleased as well.\n\nThis brings us to the desert tray. I did not have room for desert at the end of my meal... in fact, I ate waaaaay too much, but I passed the tray on the way to my booth (it's very strategically located so you see it before you start your meal). With the caveat that this is totally hearsay, I have it on \"good authority\" that the double chocolate cake is nothing short of amazing. Next time I go I think I'm going to leave room for either that or the flan.","delta.star":0.5,"review.effect":"Positive","average.stars":"3.5","review.stars":"4","sentiment":0.448761610328429,"Topic 1":0.00947254156078207,"Topic 2":0.0880852899494176,"Topic 3":0.0233561301903992,"Topic 4":0.011690216434791,"Topic 5":0.170792941413822,"Topic 6":0.0471691367557956,"Topic 7":0.11245566415472,"Topic 8":0.00426530106389736,"Topic 9":0.0944697983350265,"Topic 10":0.210302250160811,"Topic 11":0.142556701341741,"Topic 12":0.0252794224809538,"Topic 13":0.00874211077078927,"Topic 14":0.00568492082453079,"Topic 15":0.0456775745625227},{"id":769,"body":"Buca di Beppo is know for its great culture and large plates.

I had been meaning to make it down there, but due to my career choice of Wage Slave (not as glamorous as it sounds) I hadn't been able to make it out to Food Truck Friday.  Food trucks are so hot right now.\n\nAfter perusing my choices of sustenance (BBQ, Hot Dogs, Po Boys) I found myself in front of a white and orange sparkly GMC.  It was the Sunshine & Spice truck.  I was intrigued with the options of stuffing rather traditional Asian fare into a burrito or taco.  The idea of teriyaki beef, or curry chicken in a California style burritos sparked my interest, but I settled in on a mushroom burrito, a pink lemonade, and apple pie wanton (oh, they joy).\n\nThe burrito was a decent size for the price, but it was when you started maowing on it that you discover that it is a hearty wrap of tummy stuffing awesome.  You know how sometimes you get a burrito that contains rice, that turns into a rice burrito?  Not the case here.  Plenty of killer to the proper amount of filler.  Speaking of filler, the mushrooms worked as flavor sponge for the soy marinade.  Tasty town.  The home made guacamole had a nice way of pulling it all together.  The wasabi sauce was really what drew me in to ordering the mushroom burrito in the first place.  It added a very interesting flavor that set it apart from anything in the burrito/wrap lineage that I have ever put inside me.  It was awesome... except for one bite where it kicked me straight in the sinuses.  If you have gotten a bonus glob of wasabi when eating sushi, you know how it will wake you up.  Woah.  Other than the one bite that went rogue, it was good gastro-times.\n\nThe pink lemonade was pink lemonade.  Wouldn't deserve a mention if the fiery redhead who took my order didn't ladle a few strawberries into my beverage.  Nothing makes you feel more like a man than fruit in your drink.\n\nNow we come to the best part of my food ingestion experience.  Apple pie wontons with whipped cream.  There isn't anything that you can fry that I won't eat (I proved that on a sex tour of the orient a few years back).  If a crab wonton raped a McDonald's Apple Pie from the 80s (not this baked crap they have been trying to pass off), this would be the love child.  Evidently, Goldschlager would be the god father, because this baby sparkles.  No, literally.  There was gold sparkles on my dessert.  I felt so opulent.\n\nIt reminded me of a Chappelle show skit.  I told the aforementioned fiery red head that they needed to add a tagline to the apple pie wontons of \"it'll make your dookie twinkle,\" but I fear she dismissed my genius marketing.","delta.star":1,"review.effect":"Positive","average.stars":"4","review.stars":"5","sentiment":0.371076176750821,"Topic 1":0.125737657031961,"Topic 2":0.0566974325069121,"Topic 3":0.0261133242636109,"Topic 4":0.0682215670344758,"Topic 5":0.0195355510046662,"Topic 6":0.0258713828388918,"Topic 7":0.0481948573589648,"Topic 8":0.0011940804843085,"Topic 9":0.0658832773462486,"Topic 10":0.119189301123547,"Topic 11":0.0456484152936749,"Topic 12":0.0762266998725337,"Topic 13":0.134002158960439,"Topic 14":0.011341093668228,"Topic 15":0.176143201211538},{"id":772,"body":"Bad Donkey is the north Phoenix answer to Cheba Hut.

Dinner is a little bit more upscale and refined with a wonderful pork tenderloin dish and my personal favorite, the duck confit. The house made ravioli is also pretty incredible. There are new seafood specials daily, depending on the fresh product received. They have also brought back the classic whole roasted Branzino dish which is also cooked in the wood burning oven!

I have been to this place twice already since it opened. The food is delish and the service was good. \n\nThey're chips are obviously made in house (versus most of the other Mexican restaurants in the valley who get them delivered). They offer 3 kinds of salsa- their house mild salsa, a chipotle and a spicy tomatillo.  The salsas are good, the only downer is that they only provide one basket of chips, then charge for each additional basket after that. My family can go through salsa and chips in no time so this was a downer. On the contrary, the food seems to come out of the kitchen really fast (even for a Mexican restaurant) so we didn't notice the difference as much as we could have.\n\nI go the Plato de Mexicano. It consists of A cheese enchilada, beef taco and a red chile tamale. Served with refried beans for $11.95. A good sized plate. Everything was good, they don't have your run of the mill enchilada sauce which is nice. \n\nI have had the scallop and shrimp enchiladas (I believe it was a special). It was really good, served with a spicy fundido sauce, rice and beans. \n\nSomeone else at my table had the Plato Burro which is a fresh flour tortilla filled with green chile, shredded chicken, beef or vegetables. Served with rice and beans for $10.95. She opted fir the beef and said it was awesome. \n\nI would highly recommend this place. About time we got another sit down Mexican restaurant in Fountain Hills. The only reasons I did not rate this place 5 stars was because of the chips and salsa issue and the fact that they have a TON of staff working there (we counted 20 lol) and we felt kind of rushed both times. It was nothing that our waiters did, just the vibe we got from so much staff running around. Don't let this hold you back.

My friend informed me that Montreal had turned into the Hipster Hub of North America, and I did not doubt that after my night there.  \n\nAnyway, the man behind the cash register was very pleasant to deal with and made the experience more comfortable and enjoyable and we joked around with him. The poutine was pretty good, and I definitely would try it again when I am more sober, but for a 24-hour spot on a party street, it definitely hits the spot, especially since they take credit cards, and La Banquiste only accepts cash - making driving the 5 minutes there much more dreadful.","delta.star":1.5,"review.effect":"Positive","average.stars":"1.5","review.stars":"3","sentiment":0.164424554619357,"Topic 1":0.0199926209564703,"Topic 2":0.16876239464816,"Topic 3":0.138416770427613,"Topic 4":0.00489285448522638,"Topic 5":0.0126765037983684,"Topic 6":0.0454420139056854,"Topic 7":0.0859916392251206,"Topic 8":0.00815973721879051,"Topic 9":0.00720701093938198,"Topic 10":0.0050675538301253,"Topic 11":0.249283620233394,"Topic 12":0.00516279041019835,"Topic 13":0.0218795718126129,"Topic 14":0.00659026232409216,"Topic 15":0.22047465578476},{"id":807,"body":"We go to Mariners once a year because we always get a gift certificate for this establishment.

There is a decent selection of bites/sides along with starters and mains (about 4 or so) with a few specials on the boards. \n\nWe went for: \n\n- Pigs ears with salt and aioli (see photo)\n- Large Vegetarian Mezze platter with goodies such as curried lentils, kimchi, oatcakes and hummus, pickled egg with beetroot, some sort of beetroot coleslaw, amazing spicy sweet potato cakes, and Asian cucumber. All displayed on a wooden board to share. (see photo) \n- The special of oxcheeks with a star anise jus. This was a bit small. The portion was lacking for the price. \n\nMains we got: \n- Eggs ontop of tomato sauce with pine nuts, goats cheese, and flat bread. This was delicious, really enjoyed it as an interesting lunch. Nice and hot and presented in a frying pan (see photo) \n- Chicken thigh with rocket and tomato slices. It was expected that we pita chips in the salad were to be crispy, however they arrived a bit soggy. There was also an absence of balsamic on the salad, when the menu clearly stated the dressing was to contain my friend's favourite vinegar. Though, the waitress promptly brought over a small carafe with balsamic to drizzle atop the chicken salad when asked. Was a struggle to cut the chicken into smaller pieces because the bowl was quite small, however the flavours were an appealing balance of lemon with sweetness of the tomatos.\n- Smoked mackerel on a baguette.

And so when WHISKI Rooms opened up on the Mound, and I passed it day on day with all that liquid sunshine beaming out at me, I knew it wouldn't be long before I stopped in here to sample what was on offer.\n\nThe boy and I came here for a Friday evening meal. It was a lovely sunny evening and around 7.30 the place was almost full but had a really nice relaxed ambience about it, rather than rushed.\n\nI had a craving for seafood, but didn't fancy the salmon in the mains section so asked if it was possible to have the scallops starter as a main. All they did was double up the portion size, and price, equally but this suited me fine. The boy had the soup and then the burger.\n\nThe scallops, served on black pudding, were really quite delicious. The scallops were beautifully cooked and the contrast of the crispy black pudding was just mmm. It looked like a fairly small portion (despite being doubled) - it was 6 scallops in total. But I had it with a side of the seasonal veg and struggled to finish it all. The seasonal veg was also really nicely cooked - shredded cabbage and carrots, neither covered in butter or dried out - just right.\n\nThe boy's soup was, I have to say, a little bland. But hey, you win some you lose some. Despite being a creamy soup it just lacked much flavour. His burger was epic, a giant hand-made beast with bacon and a delicious WHISKI sauce and onion relish. As far as burgers go, it was good. The chips, I am told, were a little meh. (The burger + chip combo is an important one.)\n\nNow, the drinks. The cocktail list has a whole page (or more) dedicated to whisky cocktails. Oh yes. My favourite cocktail is a margarita. And what did they have? A whisky-rita. That's right, a margarita made with whisky. It even came in a margarita glass, salt-rimmed. I have to say a margarita with tequila is still better for this combination BUT I really enjoyed it and loved the ingenuinty and cheeky take on it. The whisky sour I had after was one of the better ones I've had in the city too.\n\nYou need to ask for the whisky menu itself, as this isn't provided as standard on the table. But when you do be prepared to get those reading glasses out. It's very long, in very small print. I'd guess at least over 100 whiskies. The boy was happy. And the one he ordered, a new Islay one we hadn't tried yet (Aird Bheag) hit the spot nicely.\n\nThe staff were really friendly, and the waitress and I had a wee laugh when she came to ask about my order just as I was taking a sample bite of the boys burger, which as I said was epic. Friendly, familiar and down-to-earth but still very attentive.\n\nOH! I forgot to mention the chocolate mousse. A really generous serving, really quite dense and rich which was looovellly although we were both really full from our mains.\n\nI had a really nice evening here for a relaxed post-work dinner. You could definitely rock up here straight after work and enjoy a nice meal without feeling under-dressed but it's also got some class. Due to its location and the fact its called WHISKI, serving whisky, in the capital of Scotland (whisky land) I can tell it's going to be mobbed during August. But it'll be nice to re-claim it as a local in the winter.","delta.star":0.5,"review.effect":"Positive","average.stars":"3.5","review.stars":"4","sentiment":0.663444034000786,"Topic 1":0.0732996424136606,"Topic 2":0.0545922823746348,"Topic 3":0.0296276343483316,"Topic 4":0.00824658566402607,"Topic 5":0.285321908219609,"Topic 6":0.0217042045338572,"Topic 7":0.0929260088012746,"Topic 8":0.00219707129745927,"Topic 9":0.00549893100154875,"Topic 10":0.0651351701272319,"Topic 11":0.100450751535725,"Topic 12":0.100638745626199,"Topic 13":0.0734257038046317,"Topic 14":0.00818130301411015,"Topic 15":0.0787540572377003},{"id":821,"body":"I had a Haven Burger.

Exposed beams, shinny stainless vents, beautiful wood floors and highlights of glass and copper. \n\nUnfortunately the service is not on par with the care and precision that went into the design and construction. The Maitre d' and our waiter's demeanour can best be described as surely and I immediately felt unwelcome. We were seated toward the rear of the restaurant near the  kitchen and seemed to be directly in line with some sort of cooling fan that cast a chill on our entire evening. \n\nWe were a group of 3 and ordered the Salmon Tartare, Beef Short Ribs & the Bavette. The Bavette was the clear winner. The food was good, but not mind blowing in any way. \n\nThroughout the entire evening we felt as if were causing some sort of inconvenience to our waiter who was extremely unattentive. In addition to being generally unfriendly the service we received was not on par with this level of restaurant. The bread was very slow to arrive at our table, 2 people at our table were served their plates and then we waited about 5 minutes for the 3rd dish to arrive. For my friend who ordered the Bavette the waiter did not think to bring her a steak knife so she was stuck trying to cut through it with a butter knife. When we completed our dinner we sat around for an extended period of time and no one asked us if we would like the check. After I flagged someone down the bill arrived quickly and then we were left sitting with my credit card on the table for another 15 minutes without anyone coming by to process our payment. Again I had to flag down one of the staff. Not once did someone say 'sorry for the delay' or apologize in any manner. \n\nThe restaurant was reasonably busy, but well staffed so I can't blame any of the above on a shortage of staff or excessive stress on the staff. \n\nOur overall experience at Grinder was poor. Never did we feel that our presence in the restaurant was appreciated in any manner. There are a large number of terrific restaurants in Montreal where you can spend your money and thoroughly enjoy yourself so I would recommend spending your evening somewhere else.","delta.star":-2,"review.effect":"Negative","average.stars":"3","review.stars":"1","sentiment":0.228304540699297,"Topic 1":0.00797498665610417,"Topic 2":0.0293573653165215,"Topic 3":0.0425702687216422,"Topic 4":0.00794437816453416,"Topic 5":0.267558380822666,"Topic 6":0.136827604731024,"Topic 7":0.0571769809229168,"Topic 8":0.00566921939410559,"Topic 9":0.00528330752002176,"Topic 10":0.0024037018401504,"Topic 11":0.384496544428652,"Topic 12":0.0199306808348428,"Topic 13":0.00404968047716069,"Topic 14":0.00685677732588451,"Topic 15":0.021900122843773},{"id":829,"body":"By far the best one around","delta.star":1,"review.effect":"Positive","average.stars":"4","review.stars":"5","sentiment":0.201335554959323,"Topic 1":0.0341353290327367,"Topic 2":0.177154311444435,"Topic 3":0.0730673245391538,"Topic 4":0.0262585882681572,"Topic 5":0.0444425773337824,"Topic 6":0.0482912700465153,"Topic 7":0.239757483415641,"Topic 8":0.0260013974627051,"Topic 9":0.0227209089308472,"Topic 10":0.0189469364594402,"Topic 11":0.089526913287411,"Topic 12":0.0250881717686988,"Topic 13":0.0260848421692688,"Topic 14":0.032998384382228,"Topic 15":0.115525561458979},{"id":830,"body":"I so wanted to like this place.

I've never eaten Nachos with rice before.  It was not too bad.  I thought the rice was bland and didn't add to the flavor, but it gave an interesting texture to it.  I requested the spiciest salsa they had but it wasn't that spicy at all....I guess they make it for most Gringos.  I thought the Pinto beans were ok, but could have used a little more flavor.  The chips were not home made but were of good quality.  Overall, not bad.\n\nMy friend had a Barbacoa Pork Burrito....the portion was huge!  He liked it alot.\n\nOne cool thing they had was a large selection of Hot Sauce.  I tried a few of the really spicy ones and they packed some punch.  I'm curious about their burritos & tacos and will try them if I eat there again.\n\nWill I return?

They even split it for us as we asked, so we can easily try each other orders. And try we did! It was GOOD! I mean, really REALLY good stuff. And it was lots of it. Did i mention it was good? In fact, my buddy could not stop eating it even though her kept on saying -\"I can not stuff anything else in!\" But its simply too hard to pull yourself from it.\n\nI do not give rave reviews very often, but this is totally one of them. You should absolutely check it out, its worth it. Yes, it might be in the little plaza next to the freeway and ambiance might be all but non-existent. But who cares?!? Go for food. You will not be disappointed!\n\nPS: Went there a little while ago again with thy wife. She liked it as well. They now have full bar and about 6 beers on tap, including one from New Orleans (Raspberry one, real refreshing.)\n\n\"I like\"\n\"Very nice\"","delta.star":1.5,"review.effect":"Positive","average.stars":"3.5","review.stars":"5","sentiment":0.340067453825012,"Topic 1":0.0139104503979397,"Topic 2":0.257697722063091,"Topic 3":0.0748341410252213,"Topic 4":0.0411867557802605,"Topic 5":0.0268684525832857,"Topic 6":0.104862113154407,"Topic 7":0.111385063798811,"Topic 8":0.00795849570820256,"Topic 9":0.0117268024572446,"Topic 10":0.00859347409829814,"Topic 11":0.175904277403674,"Topic 12":0.0347950249460088,"Topic 13":0.0297640655893807,"Topic 14":0.0108525272626211,"Topic 15":0.089660633731554},{"id":873,"body":"Had a couple of excellent meals here and plan on many more.

(but I created it and decided to write my review in the restaurant, hurrah!) But let me say, this place is awesome on Tuesdays because of their deal. It used to be $1.00 beer and slices...\n\nHowever it went up in price... 50 cents. So, $1.50 for each a huge slice of pizza (pepperoni or cheese only) and $1.50 domestics. That's still an awesome deal. Their pizza slices will definitely fill you up, 3 got me full and happy. On top of that, the pizza has flavor, as the owner is a New Yorker so he knows how to do it right.\n\nWhen you walk into this place it's a semi bar, so yes every drink you can think of can be made! This place is sort of a family/after workday hang out with the gang at work or watch a game. They have 6 tv's across the restaurant hanging parallel to each other, so choose where you want to turn your head. \n\nYou'll see some locals here and some that are from across town (me). But overall, the service was simplistic and not bad.\n***But I do have to say that they keep this place cold, and they don't care if their customers are cold. When we said that it was cold and my mother was wearing her jacket, one of the managers said \"well, put your hood up!\" Well, that's something what I wouldn't say to a customer... She could have just turned off the air considering it was 40 degrees outside. Note, every customer had their jacket on!\n\nThis place is okay, my rating was 4 stars but because of that person's comment towards my mom I have to dock it.

I recently came across this place yesterday as me, my girlfriend, and her daughter came out of the AMC theater at Westgate. This place must have just opened up this week as it was still closed last week when I was at Westgate. Now I want you to keep in mind that this place just opened when u go in. There isn't really anything about the look of the place that makes it stand out from any other place. The people genuinely seemed excited for us when we came in the place so that's good. Our waiter I didn't catch his name but he didn't seem to comfortable, he seemed kind of nervous. I had the Stromboli which I thought was pretty good. My girl had the greek salad, it was ok. The chicken that came on it seemed a bit dry. Her daughter had chicken tenders with french fries. She kept yelling saying how delicious it was so if u got a 4yr old go with the chicken tenders. I had a word with the person who brought our food because a couple of the chicken tenders look like as if they were bitten. They manager came out and offered to replace the meal but we didn't because she wasn't going to eat all of her meal anyways so what's one less chicken tender. We also ordered some garlic knots but we never got them. But I probably would have had I remembered then myself instead of hours later once I got home. But I guess that sums up r meal there at Mama Gina's. It was ok, but nothing really that makes it a \"must eat\" place. But I would recommend it if u happen to be at Westgate despite how my review comes across. Its just not a place that I would go out of my way to eat at. But I will give them the benefit of the doubt since they just opened this week and might need a bit of time to get situated and hit their stride. So I will probably wait and check it out again in a few months. The building its in has already been about 3 other places since Westgate open.

We were greeted by a very friendly lady who ended up being our waitress.  She had our menus and silverware already in hand and we were walked right to our table.  We didn't even slow down when we came in the front door, the seating was that quick.  Throughout the meal, she joked with us, had an amazing attitude & gave us good recommendations and info about the place itself.  The menu has a lot of great choices and she helped us narrow it down.  \n\nWe started off with an appetizer of cheese sticks, which were good, but probably a little overpriced at $6.99, but the rest of the food was very affordable.  My friend had Shawerma Sub w/ beef, which appeared like a Philly Steak style sandwich, but was seasoned differently as it's an Egyptian style meat combination with onions, parsley & tomatoes.  I had a Buffalo Chicken sandwich.  Both dishes came with fries.  All of our food was very good, but the chef/cook had gotten a little overzealous with the Buffalo sauce on my sandwich.  Other than that the food was very well cooked.  \n\nAll in all, I think her meal was under $10 and mine was over, but only because of the cheese sticks.  A very good meal that makes me want to go back and try one of the dinner type dishes like their meat loaf, pot roast or macaroni & cheese (casserole).  \n\nTip:  If you want to eat breakfast for lunch, get there before 1pm when they shut down the breakfast station.","delta.star":1,"review.effect":"Positive","average.stars":"3","review.stars":"4","sentiment":0.65306813148147,"Topic 1":0.0281084021538382,"Topic 2":0.0962242723249745,"Topic 3":0.018250865861519,"Topic 4":0.0148055585432955,"Topic 5":0.057020147897716,"Topic 6":0.0261493373476254,"Topic 7":0.198053535674685,"Topic 8":0.0479739798036336,"Topic 9":0.0295294770877672,"Topic 10":0.00404365215474161,"Topic 11":0.202020854562248,"Topic 12":0.128554297777926,"Topic 13":0.0481541295864194,"Topic 14":0.0863143492472876,"Topic 15":0.0147971399763217},{"id":897,"body":"YUMM!! excellent food and service! delicious, fresh ingredients, what more can one ask for?!! :)","delta.star":0.5,"review.effect":"Positive","average.stars":"4.5","review.stars":"5","sentiment":0.3807118160128,"Topic 1":0.0352514162604628,"Topic 2":0.0990057261383803,"Topic 3":0.0368040506203071,"Topic 4":0.0231676913146233,"Topic 5":0.0398608320185646,"Topic 6":0.0219336461775464,"Topic 7":0.457841459107196,"Topic 8":0.0233677659771751,"Topic 9":0.0169440208791457,"Topic 10":0.0154853565973254,"Topic 11":0.0838177667821775,"Topic 12":0.0236483952259547,"Topic 13":0.0140082860048261,"Topic 14":0.0625383765195621,"Topic 15":0.0463252103767523},{"id":898,"body":"I randomly stumbled upon Yume Sushi's grand opening tonight on my way back out to the parking lot from Uncorked Wine Bar (Yume is in the old Fat Burger location in the Scottsdale Promenade).  \n\nI opened the door and received the warmest welcome that I think I have ever received in any bar or restaurant!

The roll was okay...I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and allow for the takeout-delay-factor.\n\nOverall I would definitely go back to this place if I was looking for a more lowkey sushi spot than the nearby Ra, Sushi Brokers or Sapporo...but with Stingray opening at Scottsdale Quarters soon, Yume will need to work hard to stake out its claim in a very sushi-crowded North Scottsdale neighborhood!","delta.star":-1,"review.effect":"Negative","average.stars":"4","review.stars":"3","sentiment":0.335260226692094,"Topic 1":0.00679295404327186,"Topic 2":0.0943687230921711,"Topic 3":0.253253300068933,"Topic 4":0.234139528051613,"Topic 5":0.0391505313003915,"Topic 6":0.0405043190790054,"Topic 7":0.0711242415914348,"Topic 8":0.00211568393842412,"Topic 9":0.0115611455090726,"Topic 10":0.00323651377490424,"Topic 11":0.180537289131805,"Topic 12":0.0144488218785029,"Topic 13":0.0195975243632025,"Topic 14":0.00463935097216201,"Topic 15":0.0245300732051067},{"id":899,"body":"Pretty much copy paste my other Panda review.

It's tgif, so go to the mcdonalds in Summerlin to order 10 sausage mcmuffins for the office staff I work with.  Straight forward order, no drinks.  To my dismay, it's like half of Summerlin secretly decided to descend on this one mcdonalds to \"splurge\" on a morning meal (cheap bastards) and they're all too lazy to get out of their escalades (cheap, LAZY bastards).  Translation, drive thru is 15 cars long blocking the entrance into the shopping center.  So, I park & go in to stand in line at 7:45 which wasn't much better.  I see 2 visible people working both the registers and the drive thru and 1 cook in the back and a maintenance guy repairing the \"thank you\" flap on the garbage can with his drill.  After being 8th in line, I place my order. Sure with 10 mcmuffins, I can be patient.  5 minutes go by, then 10, then 15. I see the beginnings of my order being stuffed into a small, one-order bag.  No one said your order will be out soon, or apologized.  Meanwhile, I see 3 mickey d employees walk in at 8:10 (probably 10 min late), punch in and then disappear with their purses.  Now it's been 25 minutes and I'm about to be late for work, I see the mgr stuff my 10th sandwich into the small bag, and whoa, the WHOLE bag topples over onto the floor. Now I'm REALLY gonna be late for work. I just want my money back and will leave w/no breakfast.  Before I could flag the manager for a refund, I witnessed 3 employees walk over the mound of my paid-for food piled on the floor, yuck!  When I finally get the mgrs attention and nicely asked for my money back, she flippantly told me I'd have to wait for my refund until she logged into the computer. No apology for waiting 25 minutes WTF???? Hey, Don't be drinkin no hatorade this early in the morning!!! 35 minutes later, I finally got all of 11 bucks back (no credit for free breakfast) and went to work empty handed and hungry.

It's not known for its great buffets or variety of restaurants like Wynn, Venetian, or the other huge powerhouse hotels on the strip. I made reservations for The Steak House because the SW Steak House @ the Wynn was fully booked.\n\nThe restaurant's atmosphere is very common of its restaurant peers. Morton, Ruth Chris -esque type. Their menu is pretty straight forward. Geared toward American cuisine of Seafood and Steak.\n\nThe most notable items on the menu is...\n\nIce Box of Seafood (Crab Legs, Oysters, Shrimp, etc) - $50\nIts variety of Dry Age and Prime cut meat\nVariety of additions (Glazes $8-14/each, Sauces $2/each, Side dishes $5-8/each)\n\nFor my order, I went with appetizer, soup, and entree.\n\nAppetizer - Fanny Bay Oysters $12/half-dozen\nThese are medium sized oysters from Washington area. They were quite fresh and slightly sweet. Offered with sliced lemon, cocktail sauce, horseradish, and apple vinaigrette. My only complaint is that when they shucked the oysters...I found bits of the shell mixed in with the oysters while I was eating them.\n\nSoup - Lobster Bisque $10\nA little bit different than I usually find in most restaurants. A bit chunky with bits of lobster mixed in, light amounts of sherry, and a more creamy texture.\n\nEntree - 24oz Bone In Prime Cut Ribeye $38\nI order my meat RARE, so to some people that might be a bit scary. The taste of the meat changes a lot between rare to medium, etc. I prefer a chewier but very sweet taste of the meat. Rare is pink with a cold purple/pink center. Most places like Outback, Claim Jumper, Lone Star, etc tend to overcook their meats slightly due to serving hundreds of steaks a day or to be safe. Steak house did a great job of preparing and cooking my steak to the T. For the price, its a 8.5/10, just because I think they could have given me a better cut without some strands of tendon, etc in my meat.\n\nOne thing I wish I had added to my menu was a few side dishes and maybe their bernaise sauce, but with all that food I was stuffed more than 75% the way through.\n\nService\nThe service was responsive and accomodating. We didn't wait long to be seated since I had reservations for 17 but only 9 of us came in the end. Our server's name was Brandon and he tended to our needs and concerns very nicely. A few of my friends shared their dishes and he took care of it to have the sous chefs split and plate everything seperately.\n\nOverall, the restaurant lives up to an above average steak restaurant that you can usually find in most large cities. It keeps trend of business-casual with a nice cut/fresh of ingredients. The only thing that pulls away from it is the quality of food in other restaurants on the strip. Possibly for the same price, a larger menu, and a better cut of meat can be found? Average price/person = ~$40-60","delta.star":1,"review.effect":"Positive","average.stars":"3","review.stars":"4","sentiment":0.251326565539899,"Topic 1":0.00919120314053448,"Topic 2":0.0805610603770105,"Topic 3":0.019385614207603,"Topic 4":0.0393817624852321,"Topic 5":0.442462774170382,"Topic 6":0.0211735946371639,"Topic 7":0.0727741044497624,"Topic 8":0.00650175996244883,"Topic 9":0.0271808320299484,"Topic 10":0.003579219603896,"Topic 11":0.0211883377481269,"Topic 12":0.22279592526187,"Topic 13":0.0067814242966442,"Topic 14":0.00879828628861569,"Topic 15":0.0182441013407616},{"id":918,"body":"Found out about this spot from a friend.

This is very fresh, very authentic, very delicious Thai food. The restaurant is clearly in its very early opening stages. What is refreshing about the experience is that they are open and transparent about the fact and they will take the time to address the obvious kinks and give you the exact date for their resolution. Their (currently) limited menu is sure to point out that it's a temporary menu being offered only until their Grand Opening which is yet TBD. The ambiance was relaxing yet lively and vivacious. I was there for lunch and groups of people seemed to be enjoying themselves immensely and highly complimentary. I was immediately impressed by the menu; it seems as if someone identified all the best Thai dishes around the city and put them on one menu. I had the shrimp Pad Thai (which i believe should be the starting point and litmus test for any new Thai food experience), the shrimp were perfectly cooked, fresh and incredibly seasoned. The garnishing of incredibly fresh and crunchy bean sprouts along with the light dust of Thai seasoning added excellent texture and depth to the dish. The incredibly fresh green onion slivers added beautiful color and a sharpness that complimented the sweetness and spiciness of the dish perfectly. In all i found both the experience and the food to be fantastic; this notion was only exacerbated by the cordial and personal interaction of the manger (which btw is the tried and true key to long-term success on Murray Ave.) and the resourceful and friendly wait staff. \n\nFor those looking for a great new place to try and fantastic, authentic Thai food, Curry on Murray is a must try!","delta.star":1.5,"review.effect":"Positive","average.stars":"3.5","review.stars":"5","sentiment":0.809857792015454,"Topic 1":0.00744220730647847,"Topic 2":0.0241122082434146,"Topic 3":0.0271658055436394,"Topic 4":0.24871773179457,"Topic 5":0.146610209302189,"Topic 6":0.00791430936352446,"Topic 7":0.336021302460354,"Topic 8":0.00314880901427417,"Topic 9":0.0138780417579532,"Topic 10":0.00407900310265859,"Topic 11":0.0701251034677118,"Topic 12":0.0764525187488007,"Topic 13":0.00382821405395326,"Topic 14":0.00490762874244,"Topic 15":0.0255969070980385},{"id":928,"body":"Part of being a really good restaurant is being consistent. The first time that we ate here the food was great, the service was a bit slow (somewhat understaffed), but acceptable. We also took some sandwiches home and they were great as well. \n\nThe second time was a different story; we stopped in just to get some sandwiches to go. After placing the order, we waited for 30 min. for three sandwiches and the place was only three tables occupied (again only one person running the front end and sometimes the back.) Even so, we thought it would be okay because the sandwiches (last time) were so good. Not this time, two of the three sandwiches were almost completely meatless and the bread was dry (old?) What a disappointment. These people have a good thing going (food wise) if they could only get on top of the staffing (service, all service including \"to-go\") and consistency.

It is self-contained now behind a nifty hermetically sealed glass wall (due to recent anti-smoking laws). Anyways, I just wanted to review the food/restaurant alone and separate it from the rest of the bar.....However, that being said, the option to order food and get it at the bar is totally up to you and your tolerance for tobacco smoke. Vice versa, getting beers from the bar is totally separate as well, but drinking has to be done in the bar AFAIK. \n\nFOOD: This ain't Kobe beef, but save yourself the trouble of high LV Strip prices and come here for a solid 1/2 pound burger. I've eaten here many a times back in the day when I lived in Las Vegas (05' - 09') and when I used to drive long distances to visit Las Vegas (02' - 04'). This place deserves a shrine. I always recommend this place to friends, but it's not for the faint of heart. If you abhor grease, battered fries, chili-cheese fries, and all things from the griddle....look elsewhere. Otherwise, if you call yourself a \"grease aficionado\", welcome to nirvana. Cheap prices and a 24 hour availability makes this place dangerous for the waistline. Get a few beers next door and you'll praise the sedentary lifestyle soon enough. I've never had their wings, but have heard decent things and they're cheap. I always go for the build your own burgers starting for under $3 - add some Ortega green chiles, a slice of cheese and take all the fixin's (ask for a pencil and request everything on those 4x11 order sheets) and then enjoy the cheap bill b/c it never costs you more than $5 even if you get the fries for 75 cents. Seriously, take a trip off the Strip (if you're a visitor) and enjoy a part of LV flavor. If you have time to spare, knock off an hour or two and see some rhinestone glitz at the Liberace Museum as well.\n\nATMOSPHERE: It's in a strip mall with a dance studio, a Korean resto and grocery mart - but what Las Vegas place isn't in a strip mall? Lot's of blue hairs, Packers/UW fans, pool tables, shuffle board and tons of characters at all times of the day. As mentioned above....Look for the \"Rum Runner Lounge\" to get that review and ask for Birdie when you're there - she's the bomb. Again...if you hate smoking, the anti-smoking laws (as mentioned above) won't keep you separated from your greasy spoon cravings - just eat at the cafe. \n\nHINTS: If you order at the bar, be sure to tell the bartender so he/she can flag down one of the BC waitstaff. Otherwise, order at the cash register next door and bring the food in. I find that if you play on the VP machines, you'll usually get better service right away. Another added advantage is \"comp drinks\" - if you put a $20 in the VP machine and play at max bet ($1.25), the drinks are \"free\" while you can enjoy your chow with those nifty bar wood block tables. (Food isn't free - so just pay your BC waitstaff separately).","delta.star":1,"review.effect":"Positive","average.stars":"4","review.stars":"5","sentiment":0.067995441219725,"Topic 1":0.0228266216702689,"Topic 2":0.178747878069475,"Topic 3":0.269340187156712,"Topic 4":0.00984747257696668,"Topic 5":0.0109341270968556,"Topic 6":0.0456371308883294,"Topic 7":0.0521939697005256,"Topic 8":0.0125599265060147,"Topic 9":0.00974000104794075,"Topic 10":0.014775460200242,"Topic 11":0.18554471790198,"Topic 12":0.0123206682008764,"Topic 13":0.0881580059857716,"Topic 14":0.0108257603354441,"Topic 15":0.0765480726625971},{"id":941,"body":"I liked the place even when I thought it was a chain.

It was good, and other folks liked it, but I got the lasagna the first time I went there and it was so good, it's hard to try other things.  I've strayed a bit, but I keep going back to that.  \n\nHuge portions and a fun family atmosphere - though when all the seats are full it can get a bit tight.  It's not a huge place, but big enough I thought it was a chain though it's an independent building.  \n\nMeals run $12 to $23 ish, but they also run HUGE.  And not only can you share, but if you tell them you're sharing then for a few bucks more they'll split it onto 2 plates and give you an extra dinner salad.  Definitely a bonus.  \n\nLast note - if you go when the weather is nice they have a really great outdoor seating area.

If you go for a cheese pizza you should be ok, but you'd be just as well off with a frozen pie from the grocery.","delta.star":-1,"review.effect":"Negative","average.stars":"3","review.stars":"2","sentiment":0.0103691452960153,"Topic 1":0.00856497983769744,"Topic 2":0.1611610605641,"Topic 3":0.0337863201134719,"Topic 4":0.00576040682090713,"Topic 5":0.0189482166982569,"Topic 6":0.373993233145481,"Topic 7":0.08633259840555,"Topic 8":0.168909277053289,"Topic 9":0.0137682605219551,"Topic 10":0.00637705153564913,"Topic 11":0.0562164150375757,"Topic 12":0.0142449683936444,"Topic 13":0.0121920577988874,"Topic 14":0.0168554390168544,"Topic 15":0.0228897150566801},{"id":952,"body":"Two friends and I just ate lunch at Daisy Cafe and Cupcakery on its fourth day in business (today is May 21, 2009), and we were very pleased.  The service was slow (hopefully just a first-week-open problem that they'll solve soon), but the staff was very friendly and the food was delicious.\n\nI ordered the fresh vegetable strata, a souffle-ish dish of eggs, cheese, veggies, and bread cubes.  It was wonderful!  The eggs were light and fluffy, the bread cubes were a nice crusty contrast, and there was just the right amount of gruyere cheese baked into the dish to make it flavorful without being overwhelming.  It came with a side of seasoned roasted red potatoes and fresh fruit, all of which was excellent.  My friend, Michael, ordered the beef and bacon meat loaf, which came in its own adorable little dish and was perfectly cooked, moist and flavorful with lots of yummy little vegetable chunks mixed in with the ground meat.  My other friend, Haley, ordered the egg sandwich, which we all agreed was a serious egg sandwich, in the best sense.  No mere fried egg slapped on a roll with some cheese, this was, rather, a well-considered sandwich of crusty bread, egg, gruyere cheese, and red onions (which added an especially flavorful kick).\n\nFull but not wanting to pass up the bakery section of Daisy, we each got a cupcake to go.  While the presentation was lovely, it seemed rather wasteful to put each individual cupcake in its own cardboard box (with an additional stabilizing cardboard device inside).  Once I ate the cupcake, however, I realized why such accoutrements were necessary: the frosting on the cake was so soft that it was even a bit melty, and the cake itself was rather spongey and soft.  I prefer a firmer cake with a thicker, stiffer frosting, so this did not particularly suit my fancy (I did, however, appreciate the taste of the frosting, which was whipped cream, as opposed to the more typical buttercream frosting--this was much less sweet, and the fruit flavoring was quite obviously real).\n\nSo go for the meal, skip the cupcake, and enjoy the open, sunny room, the good tunes on the stereo, and the friendly vibe while you wait (hopefully not too long) for your server to take your order!","delta.star":1,"review.effect":"Positive","average.stars":"4","review.stars":"5","sentiment":0.40188660034958,"Topic 1":0.241681194441507,"Topic 2":0.0274427281961522,"Topic 3":0.00967486223182402,"Topic 4":0.0201796727760259,"Topic 5":0.0551341991546554,"Topic 6":0.0273412665888024,"Topic 7":0.0793851632131654,"Topic 8":0.0160239320571794,"Topic 9":0.0168074899144864,"Topic 10":0.0027631025430433,"Topic 11":0.0548451652625249,"Topic 12":0.29010423603324,"Topic 13":0.0215479283213176,"Topic 14":0.10330777797009,"Topic 15":0.0337612812959872},{"id":953,"body":"LOWER French to Kristen N.: Yup and they're all like that.

That means they should be expertly crafted dishes. \n\nI asked for their choice of beverages. That got confusing because I didn't want the alcohol choices, just beverages other than water. I was told the list of soda options but I asked for \"other\" nonalcoholic beverages. Finally a connection was made. I chose a lime and ginger juice drink. When I received it, there was no detectable ginger in it. The server assured me that it contained ginger because he knew they had ginger in the kitchen. Then he came back to inform me that he tasted it and I was correct. There was no ginger. Then he said the manager tasted it and said, \"oh, there's supposed to be ginger in there?\" \n\nSo, the food was ok. The chicken masala was my favorite. The chana dal was a little bland, and the saag chicken was ok. The bread was too oily. The rice was dry. And the rice pudding was kind of weird, but I liked the hint of rose water. I would have liked a creamier texture with rice that didn't seem like it was chopped up in the food processor first. And I don't know if a side of rice and a rice dessert was such a good idea. \n\nIt was an awkward time of day to go there-right between when they close for two hours before dinner service. We were kind of locked in, followed by an apology from the manager that he was not locking us in, but rather locking others out. \n\nThe non-ginger drinks were taken off our bill so for the price of our lunch $25, it was ok.

I've never thought I'd do this but I'll have to give Outback a 4 star steak rating.  Normally, when I got to their restaurant, I have ribs.  But tonight we wanted steak.\n\nThe clientele at this Outback is a mirror of the new North Las Vegas subdivisions.  Lots of different races mingling and having a great time.  Our waitress was a short Filipina woman who's hair went down to her butt.  At first she asked us what we wanted to drink - in Tagalog \"Kumusta po, anong gusto nino para inumin? (Hello sir, what would you like to drink).  She got our drinks in no time, and we had some awesome Sam Adams on tap.  We gave our food rder in English because when I speak Tagalog, it's often sloppy, and I didn't want to end up with a piece of kangaroo meat or even horse tonight.\n\nThe waitress laughed and said, \"We have no kangaroo meat\".  Thank God. So, I had the small sirloin, their most popular and smallest cut of meat with baked potato and bread.  My brother got the lobster and steak.  His was $22 and mine was $11..  Beer was $6.  What was surprising was though I got the smallest steak, they were both super thick.  We both like our steaks medium rare, and they were able to get that nice crust on the steaks with a great searing,  One slice of the meat, and juices started to flow out.\n\nEverything was delicious, and our waitress was very efficient with closing out the bill.
